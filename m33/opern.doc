Re:	Release of TYMCOM-X/XX Operating system P034/K
	Changes visible to Operations personnel

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The P034/K release of the TYMCOM-X/XX monitor will provide
    a more reliable operating system.  This release includes many bug
    fixes, performance improvements to device service routines, and
    a few new user features.  

  I. ONCE:

	The command scanner in ONCE has been overhauled and partially
    rewritten to provide the following features:

    A.  The ONCE and FILES prompts have been changed to:
	    ONCE>	[instead of ">"]
	    FILES*	[instead of "*"]

    B.  The FULL command has been added to allow a FULL DSKCLN to be
	specified.  It is no longer necessary to enter the FILES system
	to set the DSKCLN mode.  (If the operating system has defaulted
	the DSKCLN type to FULL it should never be changed to FAST.)

    C.  All commands which are potentially hazardous to the integrity
	of the system may not be abbreviated and require verification.

    D.  HELP messages have been rewritten and expanded.

    E.  The CONSOLE command has been added to allow single user access
	to a system using the CTY terminal.

    F.  The CRASH command has been renamed to BOOTS.

    G.  On 2020s, the MANUAL command now prints a message that the
	KMC-11 is not reloaded and that network communications will
	not be established.

    A sample copy of the HELP documentation available while in ONCE
    and FILES (ONCDSK) is provided at the end of this memo.



 II. EUTHAN:

	The project to remove the SPARE-LDB has been completed and
    thus, the EUTHAN program is now obsolete.  (EUTHAN's job was to
    kill off jobs "stuck" on the SPARE-LDB).  

III. TAKEIT:

	The TAKEIT program has been updated to reflect the removal of
	the SPARE-LDB from the monitor.  Please use version 47.

 IV. DSKCLN:

	During system initialization, the DSKCLN program will always
    be able to print messages on the system console.  Thus, DSKCLN can
    now report problems such as insufficient license.  (Previously,
    the system would appear to hang and nothing would be printed on
    the console.

  V. BOOTS LOADED:

	During system shutdown, the date and time now print the time
    zone as GMT following the time.  This will help to avoid possible
    confusion in determining the exact time the system was taken down.

ONCE> HELP

TYPE     Report information about the system.
         TYPE CORE   - the default minimum core available to users.
         TYPE SYSTEM - reports the system number.
CHANGE   Change information about the system.
         CHANGE CORE   - changes the default minimum user core.
         CHANGE SYSTEM - changes the system number.
FULL     Bring up the system with a FULL DSKCLN.
GO       Bring up the system with the default settings.
FILES    Enter the ONCDSK file dialogue.  This is a subsystem of ONCE
         which is normally used ONLY for restructuring or repairing
         the disk file system.  The commands in this subsystem could
         damage the file system if they are used incorrectly.  If you
         are NOT sure of what you are doing, DO NOT enter this section.
READONLY Bring up the system SUPER SHUT for emergency examination.
         Writing on the disk is prevented until a FULL DSKCLN has
         been run.  Also, you may not UNSHUT the system until the
         DSKCLN program has been run.
CONSOLE  Bring the system up STAND-ALONE on the CTY.
         This results in very limited use of the system and the
         system MUST be reloaded before it can be brought up on
         the network.  Usually ONLY used to load a network node.
DDT      Enter executive DDT.  To be used ONLY by software wizards
         for emergency patching and examination of the monitor.
         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU NORMALLY USE THIS COMMAND!
MANUAL   Bring up the system MANUALLY for DEBUGGING ONLY!
BOOTS    Crash the system with "BOOTS LOADED" immediately.
KMC      Bring the system up loading the KMC-11 but without the
         rest of the automatic restart procedure.  This must NEVER
         be used for a restart after a system CRASH.  ONLY to be
         used when the system has been taken down gracefully and
         DSKCLN has already been run.
