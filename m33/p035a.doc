Reliability

I.  Reliability

    A.  The STOPCD reporting mechanism has been made more consistent and
	additional information is provided for various types of system
	errors.  See the document STOPCD.MEM for more details.

    B.  The internal disk and memory page utilization has been reorganized
	to be consistent on all processor types (KI-10, KL-10, KS-2020, F3).

    C.  Spurious character gobblers are no longer sent to the base when a
	circuit is zapped.  This often caused the new E-BUS bases to crash.

    D.  The DSKCHR UUO has been modified to match physical and logical device
	names properly.   DSKB10 will no longer be reported as DSKB1 when the
	physical units are out of order.

    E.  The SAT (system allocation table) pages are now properly found and
	scanned using the pointers from the HOME pages instead of an absolute
	constant defined in the source code.

    F.  A system restart at location 146 will now load the BOOTS program.

    G.  Whenever the available disk space is less than 1000 pages the Big Ben
	banner will be printed every 10 minutes.  See below for details.

    H.  The base and disk channel communication information is now being saved
	in a reserved area before it can be overwritten at crash time.


II. Performance

    A.  Improve the system scheduler algorithm to take into account the type
	of job mix actually running on TYMCOM-X.  Raise the memory utilization
	requirements for each job queue and change the transition timing for
	each of the run queues.

    B.  Change the maximum number of characters in a message to and from the
	base to match the TYMNET ISIS specification so that the base does not
	always have to re-package data passed to TYMNET.

    C.  Support the inactivity timeout implemented in the P034/N version of
	the operating system.  Any frame enabled for autologout will be logged
	off the system if the frame does not run.  Thus, frames waiting for
	user input or in stopped (^C) state will be logged off when the time
	limit expires.

    D.  Diagnostic count information is now being gathered for various UUOs
	and FRMOPs during normal system operation.

Human engineering - operator changes

III. Human engineering - operator changes

    A.  The system operator is no longer asked to supply the DSKCLN type at
	system initialization if the default mode is NULL.  The system will
	automatically set the DSKCLN mode to FAST.

    B.  The system console (CTY) width is increased from 72 to 80 columns for
	greater readability.

    C.  A Big Ben banner containing the system name, daytime and available
	disk space will be printed periodically on the system console.
	The period may be adjusted by the operator with the  SET BIGBEN n
	command.  The default period is 240 minutes or 4 hours.

    D.  Whenever the date and time are received from the network an event
	message will be printed on the console (CTY) and the OPR: terminal
	to inform the operator that the time has been adjusted.

    E.  Whenever the date and time is adjusted by more than 60 minutes, the
	system will be SHUT and the console (CTY) bell will ring until the
	operator verifies the new date and time with the SET HAPPY command.

    F.  Whenever the new E-BUS base declares itself up or loses contact with
	the PDP-10 an event message will be printed on the console (CTY) and
	the OPR: terminal to inform the operator of the new base status.

    G.  The  SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY n  command is provided for the operator
	(or anyone with OP license) to set the system-wide default inactivity
	timeout to n minutes.  The initial default is 15 minutes.

    H.  Add the DEBUG command to the ONCE dialogue to allow the setting of
	various software debugging flags.

    I.  The system operator will now be prompted to change the system number
	if it is zero.  This allows a default monitor to be built and run on
	any system as long as the configuration is the same or a valid subset.

    J.  Increase the maximum size allowable for CRASH.SAV to be the largest
	possible memory size plus 1 to allow for the future implementation of
	CRASH.EXE.


IV. Support for Memorex 3650 (IBM 3350 compatible) disks

    A.  The new PAKCP5 disk maintence program can format and copy individual
	disk units on the new hardware.

    B.  The system BOOT program can recognize the system files in both blocks
	and pages in both the old and new record formats.

    C.  The operating system file structure is supported on the new geometry.

    D.  The ASP structure copy program works without any modification.

New and changed commands

V.  New and changed commands

    A.  PJOB outputs more information about the current frame. 

    B.  VERSION now attempts to use DEC version format when possible and
	otherwise uses concise TYMCOM-X format.

    C.  TERMINAL is now a complete alias for SET TTY.

    D.  MOVE, DUPLICATE, SUBMIT, ZAP and TYMVALIDATE now run the appropriate
	program from the (SYS) directory.

    E.  WHERIS now runs (SYS)RPG to find the location of a program.

    F.  FINISH and .DSKCLN may now be forced on a command line under program
	or operating system control.

    G.  TALK JOB n  now works as expected without crashing the system.

    H.  SET AUTOLOGOUT n  will initialize the inactivity timeout for a user
	to n minutes.  If n is omitted the system-wide default is used.

    I.  Allow the character "!" in addition to the character ";" at command
	level to indicate that the remainder of the line is a comment.

    J.  Make  TTY TYPE 1  and  TTY D 15  set the KATAKANA bit for both MAGNUM	
	and the TYMNET TYMSAT.  TTY KATAKANA  also works for both.

    K.  Allow  TTY TYPE  to accept a text argument and perform the same
	function as  TTY CLASS  when a valid text argument is typed.


VI. Security

    A.  Change the arguments to the LOGIN UUO and the FRMOP UUO function
	.FOCFM to include network-origin-info and project code.  This permits
	the tracking of created frames for royalty accounting functions.

    B.  Add option CF.PLI to the FRMOP UUO function .FOCFM to allow a frame
	to LOGIN a child frame and connect it to a port requesting a username
	and password which is checked against the local password database on
	the running system.

    C.  Add the new license bit QM which allows privileged jobs to manipulate
	the records in the job processor queue.

    D.  Keep a copy of the aux-circuit string used to build each circuit so
	that it will be possible to trace a given circuit after it is built.

    E.  Set the network-origin-info entry for the port whenever a command port
	is given to a new frame using the RETACH UUO.  This prevents problems
	with royalty accounting on PTY ports.

New E-BUS base support

VII. New E-BUS base support

    A.  Fixed numerous long standing bugs which caused the new base to crash
	due to protocol implementation inconsistencies.

    B.  Change the maximum number of characters in messages to and from the
	base to match the TYMNET ISIS specification so that the base does not
	always have to re-package data passed to TYMNET.

    C.  Provide more information to operations personnel on the system console
	(CTY) when the base is having problems.  Indicate the reason for the
	base crash if it is known.

    D.  Accept the new information provided by the base and store it for
	examination by the appropriate diagnostic and monitoring software.


VIII. UUOs and monitor calls (for programmers only)

    A.  The three-word buffer header used for the OPEN UUO must not be in the
	users AC block or in restricted memory locations below 140.  This was
	previously not enforced.  (Also CHANIO UUO function .CHOPN).

    B.  GETTAB tables 31 and 32 now contain the sixbit username of the users
	connected directory.  (Also called the GFD directory).

    C.  New GETTAB entries are now available for the system time zone and the
	system startup time in universal date-time format.

    D.  The DSKCHR UUO has been modified to match physical and logical disk
	device names properly so that names such as DSKB1 and DSKB10 can no
	longer be confused.

    E.  Add capability to the DATUUO UUO to return the specified time in the
	new universal date-time format and the TYMCOM-X date-time format.
	These each contain the number of days from a particular offset in
	the left half of the word and the time since midnight as a fraction
	of a day in the right half of the word.

    F.  Extend the SETUUO UUO function .STTLK to allow a string pointer to
	be used to send a message to a job.  Job 0 is assumed to indicate
	the system console (CTY) and the operator (OPR:) terminal.

    G.  Add the capability of one frame to interrupt another frame.
	1.  CALLI -151 (FINASS) to assign a channel to receive the interrupt.
	    Available interrupts are exit or logout by a specific child frame
	    and software interrupt received from my parent frame, one of my
	    child frames, a sibling frame or any frame.
	2.  FRMOP UUO function .FOCSI to cause a software interrupt on another
	    frame.  Please contact the TYMCOM-X software group for information
	    about these new interrupts and how to use them from various upper
	    level languages.
