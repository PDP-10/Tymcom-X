1.0  HOW TO BOOT IF MONITOR WAS RUNNING

     1.  Set all switches to down position except for MI and
         MEM PAR STOP.

     2.  Switch CONSOLE STOP up and then down.   This  stops
         the machine.

     3.  Press the momentary CONSOLE RESET up.  This  resets
         the  machine.   The PROG HALT light should be on at
         this point.

     4.  Set the address switches to 147 octal.

     5.  Press CONSOLE START up.  This should  initiate  the
         bootstrap  procedure.   The message "BOOTS:" should
         appear on  the  console, type <RETURN>,  and  eventually
          "LOADING (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV"  should appear.  The system 
         should come up within 5-15 minutes.



If the system does not successfully  boot  using  the  above
procedure,  use  the  procedure for loading the monitor from
tape.

2.0  LOADING THE MONITOR FROM TAPE

     1.  Mount the current monitor  bootstrap  tape  (marked
         USE  ME)  on  the  tape  drive,  set the density to
         1600BPI.

     2.  Make sure all switches are in  the  down  position,
         including MI and MEM PAR STOP.

     3.  Set 5000 octal in the Address Switches.

     4.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR STOP switch up.

     5.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PC FROM SW switch up.

     6.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CLR switch up.

     7.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
         switches back down.

     8.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI  PC  FROM  SW  and  STOP

     9.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PARITY STOP switch up.

    10.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
         This  should  start  the tape reading in.  If it is
         successful, all the lights  under  DATA  should  be
         off.  The tape takes about 5-10 seconds to read in.

    11.  When the tape stops reading in, clear  the  address
         switches and set 140 octal in them.

    12.  Press the momentary CONSOLE START switch up.

    13.  Press the momentary CONSOLE RESET switch up.

    14.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MEM PARITY STOP switch up.

    15.  Press  the  momentary  CONSOLE  START  switch   up.
         Output  should  now  appear on the console terminal
         which includes  the  phrase  MONITOR  JUST  LOADED.
         After about 5-15 minutes, the system should be back
         on the air.  If the monitor asks for  DSKCLN  type,
         type  in  "FULL"  unless  you know that it is OK to
         give another answer.

3.0  MICROCODE LOAD PROCEDURE

     1.  Mount current Microcode tape on tape drive (the one
         marked "use me")

     2.  Set  density  switch  to   density   indicated   on
         Microcode tape label.

     3.  Make sure all switches are in  the  down  position,
         including MICRO PROCESSOR MI and MEM PAR STOP.

     4.  Set 10 Octal in the Address switches

     5.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR STOP switch up.

     6.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PC FROM SW switch up.

     7.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CLR switch up.

     8.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.

     9.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI  PC  FROM  SW  and  STOP
         switches back down.

    10.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
         This  should  start  the tape reading in.  If it is
         successful, all the lights  under  DATA  should  be
         off.  The tape takes about a second to read in.

    11.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PARITY STOP switch up.

Now follow the "loading monitor from tape" procedure.

4.0  POWER UP PROCEDURE FOR F3

     1.  Turn off main power to disks.  Switches are located
         in  the  back  of the CDC disk units, on lower left
         hand side.

     2.  Turn off power to the F3  processor.   The  correct
         power  switch  is  the silver colored toggle switch
         located on the power supply panel of  the  F3,  and
         not the black circuit breaker which is located near
         the bottom of the machine.

     3.  Reset the circuit breaker in the power  supply  box
         which  is  located  in  the northeast corner of the
         room.

     4.  Power the F3 back up using the silver toggle switch

     5.  Power  up  the  disks  one  at  a  time.   This  is
         necessary  because all three disks being powered up
         at once will cause an overload and trip the circuit
         breaker.   After  powering  up a disk, wait for its
         ready light to go on before powering  up  the  next
         one.

     6.  Load  Microcode  and  Monitor  (see  Microcode  and
         Monitor load procedures)
