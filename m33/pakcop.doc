                     ------ - --- ---- ---- -------


       ((INTRODUCTION))

            The PAKCOP program is the general  purpose  utility  package
       for  establishing,  copying  and  otherwise dealing with the disk
       packs used  on  the  TYMCOM-X  for  file  storage  and  swapping.
       Through   this   program,  ID  information,  HOM  and  BAT  block
       parameters, pack formatting and any use of alternate  tracks  can
       be  established.   One  of the most commonly used capabilities is
       the copying of entire packs to other  packs,  either  to  provide
       off-line  backup  or  to  enable replacing error-prone disk packs
       with other packs.

            Since the effects of this  program  are  so  extensive,  the
       interaction   of   other   processes  on  the  TYMCOM-X  must  be
       eliminated:  PAKCOP is therefore a 'stand-alone' program - it can
       only be run after the system has been taken down;  it must be the
       only job running.  The important  consequences  of  this  program
       also  require  that  the  operator  maintain the highest level of
       caution and attentiveness  while  running  it  from  the  console
       teletype.  The RESTART and LIST commands (described below) should
       always be used whenever packs  are  moved.   During  copies,  the
       running  packs  should  be  write protected.  All pack labels and
       tags should be kept accurate.  In general, a good  precaution  is
       to DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING whenever you are using PAKCOP!


       ((COMMAND DESCRIPTION))


            When the PAKCOP program for the Ampex DM331 disk drives  (or
       IBM  3330's)  is  loaded,  it  will  print its version number and
       request that the date be typed in.  After the  date  is  entered,
       the  program  will  check  the  status of all units and print the
       information on the teletype.  PAKCOP  has  information  assembled
       into  it about which units are on what SA-10, which channel, etc.
       It can be assembled to handle the maximum  configuration  of  any
       system  so that it is only necessary to have one copy.  Any units
       not present on the system on which it is being run will simply be
       reported as off-line.

            Units  are  named  by  their  device  addresses  because  of
       possible  differences  in  configuration  between  systems.   The
       device address is in octal.  The low order digit  corresponds  to
       the number on the address plug.


            If an SA-10, SA-10 channel, or DC830 kontroller is off-line,
       PAKCOP  will  report  that  along  with  a  list  of the units it
       expected to find on that device.  Examples:  

       KONTROLER OFF-LINE, UNITS 340-347
       SA-10 CHANNEL OFF-LINE, UNITS 340-347,100-103
       SA-10 OFF-LINE, UNITS 340-347,100-103,240-241
                                                                  Page 2


       If the SA-10, SA-10 channel, and kontroler  are  all  on-line,  a
       report  will  be  made  for  each  unit.  If the unit is off-line
       (turned off, no address plug with that number, etc.)  the  report
       will be:

       '365 OFF-LINE

       If the unit is on line, the report will be

       '362 ON-LINE'

       possibly followed by one or more of the following:

       DUAL DENSITY (unit is a model ii with twice model i capacity)
       WRITE PROTECT (the read read/write switch is in read)
       UNFORMATTED  (pack format improper; needs reformatting.)

            If the unformatted message is given, PAKCOP is not  able  to
       determine if the pack is write protected.  After the above report
       of unit status, the program prompts with '*' for a command.  When
       typing  to  PAKCOP,  rubout  and control U can be used just as at
       monitor  level.   Typeout  may  be  suppressed  with  control  O.
       Commands  may  be  abreviated  to as many characters as make them
       unique.  Three characters are always enough.  when waiting for  a
       command,  PAKCOP  will  ring  the  bell  once  every two seconds.
       PAKCOP may be aborted at any time and returned to  command  level
       by typing the (esc) or (alt) key.
                                                                  Page 3


                            GENERAL COMMANDS

       SHH

            This command causes PAKCOP to stop ringing  the  bell.   its
       effect is canceled whenever a command is executed.

       HELP

            This  command  causes  a  list  of  commands  with  a  short
       description of each to be printed.

       STATUS

            This command  prints  out  the  status  (unformatted,  write
       protect, etc.) of each unit which is on-line.

       RESTART

            This command causes the program to retest the status of  all
       units.  If a unit is turned on or changed form read to read/write
       or read/write to read, this command must be used  for  PAKCOP  to
       sense  the  new  status  of the unit.  It should be used whenever
       packs are moved.

       LOAD

            This command causes PAKCOP to check the units on-line in  an
       attempt  to  find a copy of the boot program.  If it finds one it
       loads it in core and starts it.  If one is not found a message in
       typed  and  a  restart is performed without needing the bootstrap
       tape.
                                                                  Page 4


                             UNIT COMMANDS

            The following commands require a unit or a set of  units  to
       be  specified.   A single unit is specified by typing its number.
       A set of units may be specified by typing a list  of  numbers  as
       367,360,364,362  or  'ALL'  may  be  used.   If  ALL is used, the
       command will affect all units which are  on-line.   If  the  unit
       number  of  a  drive  which  is off-line, or if a bad string (not
       numbers, etc.) is typed the operator will be asked to retype  the
       drive list.  Each of the following commands is followed by either
       (list) or (one unit) to indicate whether the command will  accept
       a list of units or only one.

       LIST (list)

            This command lists information from the HOM and bat pages on
       the  unit.   If  the  HOM  and  BAT pages are not correct or have
       hardware errors one or more of the following messages may appear:

       FIRST HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE HARDWARE READ ERROR
       FIRST BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR
       SECOND BAT PAGE CONSISTENCY ERROR

       The information printed from the HOM and BAT pages is:

       UNIT ID: 360103
       STRUCTURE: DSKB LOGICAL UNIT: DSKB0
       NO COPY DATE       OR      LAST COPY DATE 12-NOV-1973
       NUMBER OF BAD REGIONS: 1
       NUMBER OF BAD SECTORS: 1
       RECORD,HEAD,CYL 5,13,107
       1 RECORDS(S)  12-NOV-1973     OR     NO DATE

            (If there are no errors indicated in the BAT pages  'NO  BAD
       SPOTS' will be printed.)

       INIT (one unit)

            This command initializes the HOM and BAT pages  on  a  unit.
       if the unit already has HOM pages, PAKCOP will ask 
       UNIT ALREADY HAS HOM PAGES, OVERWRITE? 

            An answer of YES is required (or Y or YE) in order to  write
       new  HOM and BAT pages.  The command will then prompt 'ID:'.  The
       id to be specified  is  any  6  characters.   However,  the  copy
       command  expects the first two character to be the system number,
       the second two characters to be the pack set number and the  last
       two  characters  to  be  the pack number.  For swapper packs, the
       current convention is to use the ID 3X99SW where 3X is the system
       number.  If it becomes necessary to replace a swapper pack, a new
       formatted pack can be given the  ID  3X88SW.   Then  the  running
       swapper can be copied onto the new pack.
                                                                  Page 5


       NEW (one unit)

            This command changes the id in the HOM page on the  selected
       unit.  The unit must already have valid HOM pages.  The prompt is
       'ID:'.

            The 230's and 3330's  have  the  ability  to  use  alternate
       tracks  to  take  care  of  bad  spots on a pack.  A track may be
       marked as defective with a pointer to its alternate.  Every  time
       the  defective track is referenced, the alternate will be read or
       written instead.  This  avoids  problems  with  inconsistant  BAT
       pages  on  a  copy.   PAKCOP  can  report and check the alternate
       tracks that have been set up.  A  fresh  pack  has  133  possible
       alternate tracks.

       ALIST (list)

            This command prints a list of which alternate tracks are  in
       use  and  how many remain available.  The three possible messages
       are:  

       CYL,HEAD 405,2 DEFECTIVE
       (The alternate track itself is bad)
       CYL,HEAD 405,2 ALTERNATE FOR CYL,HEAD 139,5
       (An alternate track has been set up, cyl 139 head 5 is defective)
       131 ALTERNATE TRACKS REMAINING
       (This the the number of alternate tracks still available for
       use.)

       AVERIFY (list)

            This  command  checks  that  tracks  which  are  marked   as
       alternates  are  in fact pointed to by tracks which are marked as
       defective.  The  command  will  either  respond  with  'ALTERNATE
       TRACKS  VERIFIED'  or a series of messages of the form 'INCORRECT
       ALTERNATE TRACK.  CYL,HEAD 408,18'.

       AFORMAT (list)

            This command does the  averify  function  and  corrects  any
       problems  found.   If  there  are  no  hardware  errors, the only
       response is 'ALTERNATE TRACKS FORMATTED AND VERIFIED'.

       VERIFY (list)

            This command checks the formatting of the entire  pack.   If
       the  formatting  is correct, the message 'VERIFIED UNIT 367' will
       be printed.  If the format is  not  correct,  an  error  will  be
       printed:  'UNIT 362 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15'
       or 'INCORRECT FORMAT' followed by 'UNIT 365 DOES NOT VERIFY'

            If the bad alternate track  message  is  printed,  give  the
       printout  and  the  pack  to  your  shift supervisor.  the VERIFY
       command calls the AVERIFY command.
                                                                  Page 6


       FORMAT (list)

            This command establishes the correct format on  a  pack  the
       format  command  calls  the  AFORMAT  command.  It also calls the
       VERIFY command when it has finished to insure that the format has
       been  correctly set.  If PAKCOP believes that the pack is already
       formatted, it will ask:  'UNIT 365 ALREADY FORMATTED,  REFORMAT?'
       An answer of YES will cause the pack to be reformatted.  If there
       are no errors, the message 'FORMATTED  AND  VERIFIED,  UNIT  362'
       will be printed.  Possible errors are:

       UNIT 362 DOES NOT VERIFY
       (the format was written with no error indication but won't
       verify)

       UNIT 362 BAD ALTERNATE TRACK SETUP ON CYL 135 HEAD 15
       (save the printout and notify the shift supervisor)

            Any hardware error will be followed by the message
       'FORMAT ABORTED'.

       COPY (list)

            The copy command has several options which are selected
       by KI console es 1,2, and 3. The copy command will always
       print out a list of the options as currently selected.
       the normal mode of operation is with none of the switches on.

            SWITCH 1 OFF
       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       indicated bad in BAT pages (sense switch 1)

            SWITCH 1 ON
       copy will abort if any bad regions are
       indicated in the BAT pages (sense switch 1)

            SWITCH 2 OFF
       copy will abort on read errors from source pack
       for pages not marked bad (sense switch 2)

            SWITCH 2 ON
       read errors from source pack will be reported but
       copy will continue (sense switch 2)

            SWITCH 3 OFF
       alternate tracks will be assigned for pages
       with read or write errors on destination pack (sense switch 3)

            SWITCH 3 ON
       copy will abort on read or write errors on
       destination pack (sense switch 3)

            After printing the options currently in force, PAKCOP
       prompts with:
       'SOURCE DRIVES:'

       a list of source drives may be specified. Since the program takes
                                                                  Page 7


       advantage of i/o overlap, copying more that one drive at a time
       is an advantage.

            After the list of source drives is typed, the following
       is repeated for each source drive.
       'COPY FROM 364 TO:'
       PAKCOP now wants the unit number of the destination drive
       for the specified source drive. After this number is
       supplied, any of a number of errors may result.

       SOURCE DRIVE NOT FORMATTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE NOT FORMATTED
       SOURCE DRIVE NOT WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE WRITE PROTECTED
       DESTINATION DRIVE ALREADY IN USE 
       (the destination drive specified for more than one copy
       operation)
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION DRIVE NOT SAME TYPE 
       (one is dual density and the other is single density)

            Any of these messages will cause this copy (not all of them)
       to  terminate.   Whenever  a  copy  terminates, a message will be
       printed 'COPY FROM 364 TO 362 ABORTED'.  

            PAKCOP will not read the HOM and BAT pages  on  both  units.
       any  HOM or BAT page errors will abort the copy.  The HOM id's of
       both units will be checked as well as the  copy  dates.   When  a
       copy  is  completed, the copy date of the destination pack is set
       to the current date.  Any one of a number of messages may now  be
       printed 

       DESTINATION COPY DATE LATER THAN SOURCE COPY DATE
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SYSTEM NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION UNIT NUMBERS DIFFER
       SOURCE AND DESTINATION SET NUMBERS ARE THE SAME

            Then the message 'COPY FROM 360106 TO 360206  OK?'  will  be
       printed.   The  units  are  specified  by  their HOM id's in this
       message.  If the answer is not YES, the copy will be aborted.  if
       the answer is YES, the copy will proceed as follows:

            The BAT pages of the destination unit will be  checked.   If
       any  pages  are indicated as bad, they will be checked by writing
       and reading some selected data patterns.  If any are really found
       to  be  bad,  the  copy  will  either  abort or attempt to assign
       alternate tracks depending on the setting of sense switch 1.   If
       alternate  tracks  are  assigned,  a  message  will be printed as
       'CYL,HEAD 407,3 ASSIGNED AS ALTERNATE FOR CYL,HEAD 125,8'  If  no
       more  alternates  are  available,  the message 'NO MORE ALTERNATE
       TRACKS AVAILABLE' will print and the copy will be aborted.

            After the BAT  pages  on  the  destination  pack  have  been
       checked,  the  copy  will proceed by reading data from the source
       unit, writing it on the destination unit, reading  it  back  from
       the  destination  unit, and comparing the data.  If no errors are
       detected the HOM pages on the destination pack are  then  updated
       with  the copy date and the structure information from the source
                                                                  Page 8


       pack.  the BAT pages of the  destination  pack  are  cleared.   A
       final message is printed:  'COPY COMPLETED FROM 362 TO 364'


                                 TIMING

            Below are some of the timing figures  for  operations  which
       can be done in parallel.

               OPERATION       NUMBER OF UNITS
               ---------       ---------------

                                                                  Page 9


                            HIDDEN COMMANDS


                                     NOTE

           The following commands are protected or  hidden  in  that
           they  require  two  commands  to  activate  them.   These
           commands are not normally  used.   Their  use  should  be
           limited  to  special  situations  and  to  maintence  and
           supervisory personel.



            To use one of these commands, type the command.  PAKCOP will
       respond with 'TYPE HELP FOR A LIST OF COMMANDS' 

            Then to start the appropriate command (assuming you are sure
       about what you are about to do) type 'DO IT'.

       REFRESH (one unit)

            This command reformats an  entire  pack  including  the  HOM
       pages  and  record 0's which are used to hold the alternate track
       information.  Thus all alternate track information  is  reset  to
       show  all  tracks  good and a format command is done.  the verify
       portion of the format command is not done.

       OLD (one unit)

            This command asks for a source and a destination  unit.   It
       then  makes a complete copy of the source unit on the destination
       unit.  Nothing special is done for HOM or BAT pages.  Every  page
       on  the  source  unit is coppxactly as it is.  All pages are
       written on the destination unit, read  back,  and  checked.   any
       error will abort the copy.

       ASSIGN (one unit)

            This command is used  to  force  the  setting  of  alternate
       tracks.   It  will  ask for a cylinder and head.  If the track is
       not one that is normally considered 'spare', an alternate will be
       searched  for  and  set up.  The program will report the cylinder
       and head  selected.   If  the  track  is  one  that  is  normally
       considered 'spare', it is marked defective.

       DEASSIGN (one unit)

            This command is used to "unset" alternate tracks.  It is the
       opposite  of  the  assign  command.   If the track indicated is a
       'spare' and is marked defective, it is remarked as good.  if  the
       track  is  not a 'spare' and is marked defective, both it and the
       track assigned as its alternate are marked good.
                                                                 Page 10

       ((ERRORS AND RECOVERIES))



            In most cases unrecoverable errors will  be  reported.   The
       only  case in which this is not true is if the program interprets
       the error for some other purpose.  For example, the copy  command
       when  it  is  testing  pages marked bad to see if they are really
       bad.

            There are five places where errors may happen:  Reading  the
       source   pack;    Writing  the  destination  pack;   Reading  the
       destination pack;  Checking data after readback;  And writing the
       updated HOM pages.

            If any read or write errors occur, they are analized to  see
       if  they  are  data  errors or probable hardware errors (overrun,
       etc.) If they are hardware errors the error and a message 

       PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR ON SOURCE PACK
       WRITE ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)
       READ ERROR ON DESTINATION PACK
       (PROBABLE HARDWARE ERROR)
       is printed and the copy is aborted.

            For a read error on the source pack which is a probable data
       error the BAT pages on the source pack are checked.  If the error
       is in a page marked bad, the message 'ERROR IS IN A  PAGE  MARKED
       BAD.  CONTINUING' is printed and the copy continues.

            If the error is in a page not marked in the BAT  pages,  the
       copy  will  abort after typing the error if sense switch 2 is not
       set.  If sense switch  2  is  set,  the  error  will  be  printed
       followed by 'CONTINUING'.  

            For read or write errors on the destination pack, either the
       copy  will abort after printing the error (sense switch 3 set) or
       the error will be printed  and  an  attempt  made  to  assign  an
       alternate  track.  The copy will abort only if an alternate track
       can not be assigned.

            Data compare errors always abort the copy with  the  message
       'DATA DOES NOT COMPARE BUT NO HARDWARE DETECTED ERRORS' 

            Failure to write  the  updated  HOM  pages  results  in  the
       message  'CAN  NOT  WRITE HOM PAGES ON DESTINATION PACK AFTER ALL
       PAGES COPIED'.  The destination pack may contain  incorrect  copy
       date and other wrong data.

            After an error during a copy you  should  recopy  the  packs
       again possibly using different disk drives.

            PAKCOP  only  prints  error  messages  for   non-recoverable
       hardware errors.  If the unit goes off-line the message 'UNIT 363
       HAS GONE OFF-LINE' will be printed.
                                                                 Page 18


            All other error mesages start with 'UNRECOVERABLE  ERROR  ON
       UNIT 361 CYLINER 107,HEAD 2,RECORD 14'

            The messages which may print from the SA-10 are 
       SELECT ERROR
       BUS IN PARITY ERROR
       CONTROL ERROR
       LENGTH ERROR
       INTERUPT ERROR

            Error output from the status byte would be:
       ATTENTION
       BUSY
       UNIT EXCEPTION

            And from the decoded sense bytes the following:
       BUS OUT PARITY ERROR
       OVERRUN
       INVALID TRACK FORMAT
       NO RECORD FOUND
       PROTECTION FAILURE
       DATA CHECK
       COMMAND REJECT
       UNIT IS WRITE PROTECTED
       EQUIPMENT CHECK
       PERMANENT EQUIPMENT CHECK

            The following will be printed only if no sense can be made
       from the sense bytes returned:
       UNKNOWN ERROR BYTE 1 BIT 2
