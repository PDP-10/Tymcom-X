Problem:   Logins fail with "frame capacity exceeced" for the last hour.
Diagnosis: DBTTMS had told SUBMIT to "run" (NETDB)CAN1.CTL every 15 minutes.
           Doing a FRMRUN on a CTL created detached jobs.
Fix:       "CANCEL (DBTTMS)* *" and sent mail.  Ex employee problems.


27-Jun-89 17:30 /Carl
Contact:  Carl was on-site at Fremont when problem occured.
Problem:  System 38 could not find the boot blocks or the home pages.
          Loaded system from tape; all disks were OK except for DSKB0.
          Attempted to re-create the home pages by copying a good set
          off of DSKB1.
Fix:      Problem was a read/write board in the disk drive.  Ran DSKCLN
          in check mode - no real errors.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, L Smith, F38
Problem:  System 38 crashed after getting more bad spots, this time on DSKB0.
          They had tried copying out the pack, but PAKCOP got too many errors.
Paged at 18:30 Fri - This call was to let me know that they were trying to use
          ASP to copy the one pack to tape and restore to a second pack.
Paged at 06:25 Sat - After the one-pack restore from tape, too many user
          directories had been wiped out.  Rick Daniels started a complete
          system rebuild, but it said "Reserved page already allocated" due
          to a bad spot in the middle of SPAGE.SYS.  Told him to use the
          command "TYPE BAT DSKB0" to located the bad spot and "CHANGE BAT"
          to clear it.
Paged at 13:05 Sat - Several read errors on tape 13.  They tried the rebuild
          but got read errors on tape 2 this time.  Wanted to know if there
          was anything else to try.  Told them to get FSCO to check out the
          tape drive.  Or try previous week's tapes.
Paged at 13:25 - No message for Joe Smith, but call still open?
Paged at 13:45 - No message for Joe Smith, but call still open?
Paged at 18:25 - The call I answered at 13:05 was aparently listed as open
          for Hardware Support.  Bill Wu finally answered, and referred the
	  call back to Software Support.
Paged at 03:05 Sun - System F38 died with a RIBERR while restoring from TITO
          tapes.  Told them to try again, and call back if it died again.
Paged at 04:02 Sun - F38 died with WRTSAT and BADSAT stopcodes.
          Went on site.  Disk unit BPB3 had 3 soft errors, no had errors.
Paged at 05:55 Sun - Central Dispatch had been trying to get a hold of me
          since 03:05.  While one the phone they tried calling (415)498-3841
          but it did not go through.  Told them to add (408)977-7962 as
          my secondary pager number.  Ross Zoerhoff informed.
07:07 Sun - Several reports of BADSAT all on disk unit BPB3.  This time it
          received 28 hard errors.  That pack is unusable and has been the
          cause of all problems in the last 10 hours.  Told them to call in
          the FE or Rick Daniels to deterine which of the remaining 3 packs
          to use.  The rebuild process will have to be done over again.

Contact:  Fremont Operations (415)498-2588, Mike Silva
Problem:  One of the disks went off-line.  B39 got about 7 disk-related
          error messages (continuable stopcodes) pointing to several files.
Fix:      Told them to login MANUAL and try to do a DIR on each file that
          had been having problems.  If no BADSAT or BADUFD problems, just
          do a FULL DSKCLN.  No further problems were reported.
FSR: 246-1490-44     No fault found (problem went away)

         MUP  (SYS)SPAGES.SYS[1,4]
Diagnosis: Before the ADD-PACK, the EOF to SPAGES.SYS was in a spare RIB.
        After adding the entries for 2 new cylinders, the EOF was back in
        the prime RIB.  REFSTR updated the words-allocated (index 10) and
        pages-allocated (index 36) in the RIB that used to be EOF.
Fix:    Changed DSKB13 page 11 index 10 from 200024,645070 to 200024,1070.
        Changed DSKB13 page 11 index 36 from 200024,1762 back to 200024,1116.

        Unpunched (APLIB)HD2601.N00 by setting DSKB11 page 15667 back to
        200024,1762.  (The file had not been damaged - the data was still
        there).

12-Nov-88 13:40 /Joe
Contact:  Dallas Operations (214)637-7435
Problem:  MAGNUM reports errors in the KEEP.OPEN file when users logged in
          as NETCON and DBCSERV try to use NETDB.
Fix:      Restarted XEXEC and forced it to run (NETDB)DCOMUP.  When MAGNUM
          starts in directory NETDB:23, it says:  "To report system problems,
          please contact: Mike Agne at (602)893-2963"  On D56, it still says

Contact:  Fremont Operations (415)498-2588, Mike Silva, System 33
Problem:  Look at CRA011 (AR.ARX) to determine what bit caused the crash.
          Examined crash:  Was User mode AR parity error, instruction in
          crash was the same as in the user's program [LOADII?], however
          since it was an AR error, there was no way to determine if the
          data matched without a dump of the user's core.
Close:    Called Mike and gave him the information to pass on to Bill R.

Contact:  Fremont Operations (415)498-2588, Mike Silva, System 26
Problem:  Look at CRA010 and CRA011 (both AR.ARX) to determine what bit is
          causing the crashes (XXX hardware).
Consulted: Joe to interpret (M33)IME.CMD on these and Joe looked at BACKUP.SHR
          which was running in both crashes and determined it was bit 31 that
          was dropped in each crash dump.
Close:    Called Bill Richardson back and relayed the information.  He will
          swap out the appropriate boards as soon as he is able.

          The KS and/or its micronode keeps crashing.
Fix:      Upgraded to S33-P035/D-8 (was running S33-P034/P-10).
          They should try using an LSI-11/73 (in place of the 11/23) so that
          the micronode can handle 2 sync lines at 9600 baud.

Problem:  TRW had a head crash on DSKB0 and DSKB1 at 5:14pm Friday the 23rd.
          After aligning new heads and formatting new packs, "the FE was
          unable to IPL the system".  This call was a warning from Tina
          that she might need assistance in rebuilding the system.
          I.e. this is not yet a hotline call, but may turn into one.
26-Aug-88 19:20/Joe             (Dispatch beeped at 19:22)
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, System 33, (415)498-2588
Problem:  System when down with RIBBRP on (EBUS)[3,317016].UFD and Mike wanted
          to know how serious it was.  System 54 was scheduled to be down
          for the conversion to pages at 20:00 and System 33 was supposed to
          be up all weekend.  He was worried about bad RIB in UFD.
Action:   Had them bring the system up MANUAL so I could check the UFD.
          No RIB errors were found.  Considerring that I had 5 jobs GFD'd
          to EBUS when it went down, it might have been a bad RIB pointer
          in a DDB, meaning everything on disk was good.  Told them to force
          a FAST DSKCLN so that it would finish before D54 was scheduled down.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Debbie Hightower, System XJJJ0029 , (415)498-2588
Problem:  Bad file (SYS)HOME.SYS on DSKB5(BPA16) page 4.
Fix:      This page is part of BOOTS.  As long as DSKB5 does not get moved
          to BPA0 or BPA10, this will not cause any problems.
          The bad page has been reassigned to the file DSKB5.BAD and
          marked NFS so that TITO will ignore it.

Contact:  "Fountana" Data Center, Mike Silva, System 26, no incident number.
Problem:  PAKCOP hung after copying cylinder 504 on BPA2.
          Select light off, no action in memory lights, no response to the
          attention button.  They wanted to know if it was OK to do an ASP
          save on the 3652.  BPC2 copied out OK.
Fix:      I suggested they try the OLDC command.  It got an unrcoverable
          error on cylinder 473.  Told them to do the ASP one-disk save.
          This worked, but BPC2 had a "missing or inconsistent pack set id",
          which was to be expected.  After putting a JFCL at STRFIX, the
          system came up running a full DSKCLN.

24-Jul-88 13:00/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, L T Smith, (415)498-2588, System 32
Dispatch: Called me at home, said they paged me twice with no response,
          however L T's page came thru (I was outdoors in Fremont at the time).
Problem:  X32 had  3 crashes after Lenny replaced some boards, an IME, a UIL,
          and PAGP3R.  System ran DSKCLN with no problems, died only while
          running diags (such as MEMEXR or XCORE).  Lenny wanted to know
          if this IME is the same as the previous ones.
Diagnosis:  IME caused when PC was set to the middle of CTYLOG.  There were
          no tracks as to how it got there.  The IME is not related to the
          SKIPLE J,.CPJOB problem this CPU was having earlier.

23-Jul-88 09:00/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Debbie Hightower, (415)498-2588, System 32
Problem:  Lenny was running diagnostics, trying to reproduce the problem on
          CPU 1336 (B39).  The two-pack test system would fail, but diags
          wouldn't.  Between the time I was paged and when I answered,
          DDQCB failed on bit 27.  All he needed at this point is verification
          that it was the same bit that was set in the IME dumps.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Brad Dong, (415)498-2588, System 74
Problem:  F74 has bad home page on BPA12 - hard read error on 1st + 2nd HOM
          PAKCOP can's see unit 312.  Asked them to call back after the
          disk has been fixed.

20-Jul-88 22:08/Joe
Incident: none, just message to call Mike Silva at Fremont Data Center
Problem:  B39 crashed with IME again, 6th time today.
          It passed diags, including 'B' string, but died even on the two-pack
          test system.
Status:   I was unable to login with the system up MANUAL because username
          JMS does not have shut-override on BUBBNET.  (Neither does OPER!)
          System would not stay up long enough to run fast DSKCLN using
          NOINITIA.  I had Mike bring B39 up in CONSOLE mode to copy all
          the crash dumps to tape so they could be restored to X32.
Analysis: All crash dumps are very consistent.  Page fault at USRCLK+4.
          The only way to get there is via:

17-Jul-88 10:50/Carl  Paged by Dispatch (only)
Incident: #49, closed by Bill Richardson on Monday.
Contact:  Fremont Operations, LT Smith, (415)-498-2588, System 58.
Symptom:  RIBHRE and SAT2ND stopcodes on console.  System will not come up.
Problem:  An entire string of disk drives apparently lost power.  FSC paged
          to look at the string and determine the extent of the damage.  I
          checked in later and FSC was swapping out the string controller.
          Rick Daniels was there and was going to make sure DSKCLN finished
          properly after the system was brought up again.

13-Jul-88 13:30/Carl  Took call for Osman at the office, dispatch not called.
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Dan & Joe, (214)637-7434, System 31.
Symptom:  System up, BADPAG 20631 and many many RIBHREs for LOGOUT on console.
          LOGINN not found.
Problem:  Page 20631 was the RIB for [1,4] UFD and subsequent RIBHREs were on
          the UFD rib page as well as one which may have been LOGOUT.SHR, but
          the monitor may have failed the lookup on this file because it was
          unable to update the access date in the UFD ([speculation]).
Fix:      Had operations poke REFLAG so I could login and look around.  None
          of SYS was available as expected.  Remainder of UFDs were intact.
          Got TSTSUP from tape and found RIB for SYSUFD was page 20631.  Made
          a duplicate of the RIB using system 55 as a model with adjustments
	  for missing pages.  [This did not seem to work.  Made exact copy of
          RIB from 55 with holes for missing pages and only those pages setup
          by the REFRESH in the reconstructed RIB].  Restored as much of (SYS)
          as was possible before running out of disk space.  Pared things a
          little and restored remainder of critical files: LOGINN, LOGOUT and
          (after trying to run DSKCLN) INITIA.  System up SHUT and remainder
          of all-files and backups of (SYS) restored after FULL DSKCLN.  Set
          SCHEDULE 0 and started XEXEC.   Done!   Time: 18:30 !

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, (415)498-2588, System 30
Problem:  System 30 is moving to the drives system 32 has been running on.
          X32's monitor sees BPA0-7, BPA10-17, BPB0-7 as being present,
          BPB10-17 as unit error, BPC off-line.  That matches the hardware.
          F30's monitor sees BPA0-17 then hangs.  B39's monitor does the same.
Fix:      12:54/Joe Created KONEND.PAT and applied it to (SYS:30)NEWMON.SAV.

Contact:  By Craig for Fremont Operation, Mike, (415)498-2588, System 26
Problem:  System crashes while running TITO in username BETATEST doing
	  the daily BACKUP.
Action:   (1) Brought system up manually.  Gfd to BETATEST and back would
              crash the system.
	  (2) Ran FULL DSKCLN.  DSKCLN found 15-20 bad files in BETATEST.
	      File names were all garbled-up.  Asked oper to put a access.msg
	      in BETATEST about the bad files.
	  (3) Ran CKSUM of all of the files in BETATEST OK.  System up OK.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick Daniels, (415)498-2588, system B39
Problem:  LOGICAL UNIT 0 MISSING FROM DSKB and HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERRORs.
Diagnosis: Pages 2 thru 10 on DSKB0 got overwritten by ASCII text.
	It was a log file from someone generating node code from T12014.TYM.
	Page 1 had SIXBIT/*PEAK*/ in the first word, most likely it was
	(DGRAHAM)046PEA.001[11334,427741] (since fast DSKCLN complained that
	that file was not marked in the SATs).
Fix:	Pages 1 and 6 re-created using DSKB1:'s HOM pages as a template.
	Pages 2 and 7 reset to be empty BAT pages.  Pages 3,4,5 rewritten by
	running BOOTS, page 10 rebuild using F29's RIB to SAT.SYS as a guide.
	Running fast DSKLN in check mode reported only the 046PEA.001 file.
	B39 answered at 18:53.


12-Mar-88 05:02/Joe (Pager said 817-637-7435, they didn't call Central Dispatch)
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size", even though the new DSKB had the same
          number of units as the old DSKB.  7 spindles of 3652 = 14 units.
Diagnosis: Dallas is still running ASP version 6.  That version cannot restore
          from an tapes written from a system using 14 units of 3652 disks.
Solution: They started a rebuild from TITO all-files tapes.  After they had
          restored SYS, I copied ASP version 7 from OSU to SYS on D55 and all
          other systems in Dallas.

11-Mar-88 00:23/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, David Jorgenson, (415)498-2588, System 32.
Problem:  When bringing up the system READONLY to run ASP as part of operator
          training, it died with a NONAME stopcode in SCHED1.
Diagnosis: LOGINN was trying to update the LUD to turn off the 6 letter bits
          to indicated that OPER had seen the "system is going down" message.
          During READONLY, updating ENTERs are allowed.  However, when the
          program issues an OUT uuo or VALPAG chanio, the system crashes.
Solution: Told them to come up MANUAL this time to do the ASP.  Later analysis
          showed that they could have come up MANUAL, run TAKEIT to HANG the
          system, and then come up READONLY.
Note:     Looking at the monitor source code implies that this bug existed
          prior to P034/N.  One way around it is to come up using "NOINITIA"
          and "FULL", then login as OPER (which clears the bits in the LUD)
          to run TAKEIT and "HANG" the system.  That leaves the files is the
          proper state to bring up "CONSOLE" and "READONLY" so the OPER can
          login and run ASP.  This will be fixed in next release of the monitor.

10-Mar-88 17:12/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System 30.
Problem:  One user had 30 jobs logged in, all detached, all running MAGNUM
          programs.  The jobs would not go away immediately - LOGOUT and TAKEIT
          only evicted them.  System was heavily loaded.
Solution: None.  By the time I logged in, all these jobs had logged out.
          MAGNUM enables notice-to-quit (NTQ) so that it can clean up after
          itself and leave the database in a consistent state.  Until the clean
          up is done, the job can be evicted but not killed.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System F74.
Problems: Japanese users got "FATAL ERROR A16.xxx".
Diagnosis: While restoring some missing files to directory UAS, the protection
          of (UAS)RTYACT.CTL got set to ALL RD NO.  This meant that no-one
          could run MAGNUM without setting RF license.  RDIST reported that
          all other systems had it as ALL RD RD.

20-Feb-88 02:10/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick Daniels, (415)498-2588, System F26.
Problem:  He was attempting to add BPA10 and BPC10 to DSKB:.  After enterring
          the name, the system did nothing.
Diagnosis: The routine to refresh a single pack (PAKREF) can handle the case
          where SPAGES.SYS never existed, but cannot handle the case where
          SPAGES.SYS got deleted.  There was a nonzero pointer in word 21 of
          the HOME page pointing to page 13 of DSKB0:.  What it pointed to,
          however, was not a RIB.  Had to manually bypass that part of PAKREF.
Cure:     A dummy SPAGES.SYS has been created.  DSKCLN needs to treat SPAGES
          as a critical file if its pointer exists, ignore if not present.
          The monitor needs a new routine to verify the RIB, designed to be
          called from REFSTR and ONCDSK as well as FILRIB.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System F29.
Problem:  TITO all-files aborted on tape 13 while saving USEVAL.  Tape 14 was
          started with USEVAL, completed USEVAL and 400 more files, then aborted
          9 files into VBURKE.
Diagnosis: TITO has a limit of 43777 tape positions (18431 files) per tape.
          Directory USEVAL has 18075 files.  Tape 14 couldn't hold any more.
Solution: Simply go to tape 15 with "STORE ALL STARTING WITH (VBURKE)".

Contact:  Dallas Operations, Dennis Smith, (214)637-7435, System D56
Problem:  Crashed with SAT2ND at after a REDSAT problem on BPA13 page 66000.
          Started a full DSKCLN, but it aborted when it could not read the SAT.
          Also, BPA6 2nd SAT page consistancy error.
Fix:      Brought system up in MANUAL mode, fixed hard read error by writing
          to the page.  Full DSKCLN ran to completion, answered at 20:58.

6-Oct-87 18:45/Osman
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Tim, (415)498-2588, System 33
Problem:  DSKCLN got hard read error on [1,1].UFD and aborted.
Fix:      Joe wrote page back out to disk with TSTSUP.
          (more to be added here)



16-Sep-87 10:40/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, System 26
Problem:  Disk BPA3/BPC3 had a bad HDA.  PAKCOP was unable to copy out some
          pages, one of them was a UFD data page for [1,4].  DSKCLN aborted
          because the garbage there on the new pack had wrong hash code.
Fix:      This particular UFD page did not have any *.SYS files, therefore it
          could be replaced by a hole.  It was the first page in the UFD, and
          used to have the first 102 files on the TITO save.  Said files were
          restored from tape with no problems.


28-Sep-87 19:41/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, System 38
Problem:  DSKCLN complained about "critical file damaged", LOGINN not found.
          BADSAT, BADUFD, REDSAT, and HUNG occurred just before crash.
Diagnosis: The self pointer to [1,4].UFD was corrupted - file marked bad.
Fix:      Found TSTSUP in another directory, corrected the bad pointer and
          cleared the RIB status bit.

          give them the erroneous message "Don't bring the system up
          may cause system crashes etc.."  Advise him that the message
          is erroneous and will be fix in next version of DSKCLN. Told
          him to continue what he was doing.  Also asked him to run a

Problem:  While doing a PAKCOPY, accidently initialized the source pack.
Fix:      Created 30XX02 on (M33:33) because it has TSTSUP in it.
	  Put BPA13CB at UNTTBL+12, rewrote HOM page on DSKB12 using DSKB22

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick, (415)498-2558, System F33.
Problem:  One of the new 3650 disks has hardware problems - kept going offline,
          now gets unit check one a particular cyl/surf/head.  PAKCOPY gets
          stuck there, even with sense switch two set.  Rick wanted to know
          if he should go ahead with ASSIGN and DEASSIGN to reformat that one
          track.  25 blocks will be lost, but the rest of the pack can then be
          copied.

Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7436, System D55.
Problem:  While restoring files for the rebuild, TITO said some files were not
          getting XC license.
Solution: Poked the job running TITO, told them to continue and re-restore all
          the problem files (including, of course, XEXEC.SAV).

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2558, System F33.
Problem:  Front-end 11 died, tried to run TAKEIT to bring system down, but
          CHKPNT was stuck with JACCT on (it was waiting for the SETUUO to
          finish typing on the CTY which was not responding).
Solution: Logged in, tried to set license to use MDDT, but got stuck in ML
          because CHKPNT was stuck.  Told them to get FSC to try to clear the
          PDP11 that KLDCP could deposit nonzero in 30.  Else power off KL.

Contact:  System F70, Fremont (415)498-2588, Mike or Rick Daniels.

Problem:  Many read errors on BPA4, could not access LUD, could not login.
          Brought system up Manual/Reflag and ran DSKCLN in checking mode.
          It found many problems on logical unit 2 (BPA4:DSKB2) including
          bad SATs and bad RIBs.  It was also getting hard device errors.

Action:   Had Rick attempt a PAKCOP operation and have FSC look at the drive.
          At 2:15 am called back and found that PAKCOP was having problems
          and FSC was looking at the drive again.  Found bad board in HDA
          and were trying diags and PAKCOP again...  Rick will call me if
          they still have problems... although if they cannot do a successful
          PAKCOP the only real choice is to do a rebuild from ALL-FILES.
          Note: OSMAN, why can't they run ASP on 365x's at this point?


17-Apr-87 19:00/Carl
Contact:  System F26, Fremont (415)498-2588, Bonnie, Mike.
Symptom:  Two DSKB0, DSKB1 units.  Two last units in structure.
Problem:  Drive BPA7/CPA7 was supposed to be in CE mode, but apparently came
          on-line (probably someone hit the attention button while the system
          was up previously).  BPA7/CPA7 has a 2-pack structure on it.

Solution: Put BPA7/CPA7 off-line (CE mode or power it off) and reboot the
          system from tape or disk (after getting a fresh copy of boots).
          This took 3 1/2 hours because nobody at the center understood what
          the state of the drive was and Memorex maintains it.

16-Apr-87 23:40/Carl and 23:59/Joe
Contact: System D25, Dallas (214)637-7435, Greg
Problem: System was taken down to run DSKCLN just before running ASP.  D25 was
         brought up on SYSTEM.SAV (the /B-1 monitor for 3675 disks) instead of
         NEWMON.SAV (/B01 for 3652 blocks).  Monitor went to the wrong spot on
         the second track looking for 2nd HOM and BAT blocks.  It asked "do you
         want to initialize the BAT page?"  The operators responded "yes" which
         wiped out the RIB to SAT.SYS.  Loading the correct monitor produced
         a noname stopcode when the SATs could not be found.

DSKB0  | 2nd BOOT  | 3rd BOOT  |  2nd HOM  |  2nd BAT  |RIB for SAT| 1st SAT   |
DSKB1  | 2nd BOOT  | 3rd BOOT  |  2nd HOM  |  2nd BAT  | 1st SAT   |RIB SPAGES |

3650P    record 05   record 06   record 07 * record 01   record 02   record 03
  * = end of track, switch to next head

When pages 6 and 7 (2nd HOM and 2nd BAT) were rewritten, BPXKON went to records
07 thru 14 on the 2nd track.  For a 3650/52 in blocks, these records belong to
the last 1/4 of page 7 (2nd BAT), all of page 10 (RIB to SAT.SYS), and the
first 3/4 of page 11.  Page 11 of DSKB0 is a SAT page.  On all but three of the
other disks, page 11 is a spare RIB for SPAGES.SYS.

  The damage to page 7 is fixed by rewriting the BAT pages correctly and the
SAT pages are rebuilt by a full DSKCLN, but the RIB in page 10 had to be
rebuilt by hand twice.  Once so that ONCDSK could build the table which points
to the SATs to come up in MANUAL mode, the second time using TSTSUP to write
the corrected data to the disk.  (We had problems trying to convince ONCDSK to
write the corrected page out.)  All the spare RIBs to SPAGES.SYS got punched
because they had zero instead of valid back-pointers.

Problem: After move to Fremont, unable to get directory of new ALL FILES tape.
         TITO reports 131072 BPI, 39352 tracks.  Drives work on 26 but not 29.
Fix:     Sounds like problem lies after SA10 and before tape drive.  Suggested
         that FSC check tape controller.
Call-back at 23:55 from Ali.  SPAR could not find problem.  Will try swapping

Problem: After doing ASP, full DSKCLN did not come back for 1.5 hours
Fix:     Installed DSKCLN version 36J(103).

 1 Mar 87 8:31/Carl
Contact: System F74, Fremont
Symptom: DSKCLN gave error "Bad rib detected in critical file"
         It listed (SYS)1022F.SHR and (SYS)DIRIT.SHR wtih WHC which means
         the entries had the wrong hash code.

Rerun of DSKCLN in checking  mode found additional files also bad...
so I looked at the UFD and found page 4 had what looked like blocks
2,3 and 4 copied to blocks 1,2 and 3.  All the rest of the pages looked
OK.  I BLTed the data to the right phase and erased the duplicate data.
Ran full dskcln in checking mode and intend to turn the system over
to operations to come up with REFLAG set and restore all of SYS from the
previous all-files/backup tapes using MODE SYS NEWEST after first doing
a full dskcln.

Tuesday,
  4 or 5 calls - all related to system 35's problems.
  Problem eventually solved as per my previous messages.

Thursday,
  2 calls (so far) - system F74, Bonnie

  Problem.  System had one or more SAT failure messages on OPR or CTY
after which some files became inaccessible (SYSTAT for one) and they
reloaded.  Accounting under username APACCT complained of RIB errors
both before and after the reload.

  One file in their directory had a bad rib.  2 in TAPELIB.  I ran FNDBAD
and it generated a list of files with HRE and the three files mentioned
above without saying what was wrong with the three files.  It turned out
these are bad ribs.  (Joe, FNDBAD ought to say what is wrong!)

  2nd call was from Tim in Fremont because he couldn't restore the
files which had RIB errors.  Even with license he couldn't delete them.
I told him about the DELETE FILE.EXT/BAD command/switch and the files
were deleted ok.

Problem: Could not GFD, could not LOGIN, then crashed with and APRFAT stopcode,
         "CDP" Cache Directory Parity Error.
Fix:     Told him to call maintenance to run diagnostics.  I don't expect any
         thing to be found - CDP is usually cleared by reloading the system.

Problem: PAKCPX saw only units 300-307 on the string of 3652 disks.
Fix:     Told them to try PAKCP5.  If that does not work, have the 3674
         wired for bits 2,3,4 all don't care to make all 8 strings show up.

Problem: SPLFIX "repair" could not find FDF records, files not printed.
Fix:     Told them to use "R SENDMAIL" to "DENCOFF" for these problems.
         Problem not critical enough to fix in the middle of the night.
	 Dennis ran (SPPOPER)SPFIX, command FIXFDM.

Contact: System 39, Cupertino, Abdul
         Abdul did not call the beeper number, did not let Carl's phone ring
         long enough to be answered, then called Joe at home.
Symptom: System dies with FILAUU while doing TITO all-files with P035/B.

Problem: DECUMC called with P2 pointing to a job's dummy ATB instead of a real
         ATB.  FILAUU complains when it decrements some random JBT table to -1.

Solution: Ran DSKCLN 36J(103) in check mode - no problems reported.
         Gave them B39-P035/B01 since it has the FILAMO bug fix and it types
         out the ATB on FILAUU/FILAMO/FILAUS and related stopcodes.


System D31, 5:00pm-6:20pm, Dallas OPS, Lois @ 214-637-7435

Symptom: Files and UFDs disappeared or became unaccessable without any
         apparent reason.  Lois was running a MAGNUM procedure under
         (BILLING10) and got a fatal magnum error and couldn't proceed.

Problem: One of the disks had a SAT Failure just prior to the problems
         which occurred.

Solution: As per procedure setup by Tom Marconi, I told them to take the
          system down and run a full DSKCLN and call me back when it was
          complete.  DSKCLN went as expected, no failures were found and
          the system was back up an answered prior to 6:20pm when Lois
          called back.

Contact:  Fremont D.C., (415)498-2588, Aloja, System D58.
Problem:  Many HDEVs on BPA2 and BPA3 and THUNGs on all drives.
          Can't run programs from (SYS).
Action:   Operation took system down to run FULL DSKCLN, disk clean
          found about 40 bad files, still many errors on BPA2/3 and THUNGs.
          Tried to copy out the pack but couldn't. Head 28 was failing
          all the different cyclenders. FSC looked at the disk and
          had solid failure on head 28 also, looks like bad HDA.
          Started to rebuild system from ALL-FILES which was started
          Friday and finished couple of hours before system was gone
          down for the disk problem.

02-Jan-87 14:00/Osman
Contact:  Cupertino Operation, (408)446-7705, Barbara, System B36.
Problem:  Operation tried to recycle the system because of earlier complaints
          from users "NO LUD" message.  Could not run DSKCLN until LUD was
          restored, but LUD.SYS may get clobbered by DSKCLN if the SATs are
          not right.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, Kevin, System 58.
Problem:  Sunday night operator unfamiliar with the side-effects of BADSAT,
          was confused when TITO could store a file once, but could not
          lookup files the next time.  Told Keven about forcing fast DSKCLN.

01-Dec-86 06:59/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operation (415)498-2588, Mary Larios, System 58.
Problem:  System crashed with many BADSAT, GIVPG1, FILAUS.
Fix:      Ran DSKCLN, system now up.
22-Nov-86 17:44/Joe (Carl did not answer 3 beeps)
Contact:  Cupertino Operation (408)446-7705, David Jorgenson, System 26.
Problem:  Same as 9-Nov - System gets BADSAT when TITO all-files gets to
          directories starting with "O".  Sometime later it gets error reading
          RPG.SHR, then dies with something like USRUS1 stopcode.
Workaround: Whenever system gets BADSAT while TITO is doing the all files,
          let system stay up until either TITO gets error reading files or
          users get error reading files from SYS, then force a fast DSKCLN
          and tell TITO to resume starting after last complete directory saved.


19-Nov-86 09:08/Joe (Craig called me, no answer from Carl)
Contact:  Dallas Operations (214)637-7435, Louis, System 54.
Problem:  When operator runs RCHARG against spool requests, his terminal
          hangs up. RCHARG is in an infinite loop, no files open, Control-C
          trapped, no messages.  (Host out of ports, FREE not running.)

Fix:      RCHARG.SHR had wrong checksum.  Restored from backup.
16-Nov-86 18:15/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Vijay, System 22.
Problem:  Could not set license after restoring from 14th's incremental.
Diagnosis: TITO complained about two files:
          (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO not given license WC
          (BOFANET)ONTYME.SAV not given license AC (SY,HF,RF,WF)
Fix:      Ran SETE then SETLIC on those two files.  System now up.
Note:     Carl and I have been discussing ways of giving license to TITO
          instead of to the operators.  We need to do something about it.

16-Nov-86 04:45/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, L.T. Smith, System 22.
Problem:  When rebuilding the system, do all the packs have to be the same?
Answer:   ASP dumps DSKB0, then DSKB1, etc.  It does not matter if DSKB0 has
          moved from BPA1 to BPA7.  If the system had 14 packs when ASP was
          run, then it must have 14 packs when restoring.  The physical
          location of the packs is irrelevant.

15-Nov-86 11:35/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Fred, System 22.

Problem:  Initialization failure - bad UFD.  DSKCLN not running.

          Logged in over shut, found OPER.UFD unreadable, as well as M33.UFD
          and others.  Ran TSTSUP, it reported DEVICE error while trying to
          read page 4 of [1,1].UFD data.  PSP reported:

09-Nov-86 13:08/Joe (got call at home after no response to page)
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Barbara, System 26.

Problem:  Many "CAN NOT READ FILE" errors from TITO, "I/O error on SYSTAT.SHR",
          could run LOGINN and LOGOUT from SYS but not much else.

More Info: There were two INFO stopcodes BADSAT.
          STT:200412  STTFPC:001544  SATCNT:001543  BPA11 page 10
                      STTFPC:001130  SATCNT:001127  BPA4 page 10
          This is the first time the STOPCD has printed out completely, note
          that the current count of bits is one less that what the monitor
          expected.  A full DSKCLN was requested.
08-Nov-86 02:10/Carl
Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7445, Greg, System 25.

Problem:  System 25 had been down the previous evening with disk or
          controller problems.  Joe was expecting to use the system for
          testing but was unable to have access until after 10 PM.  They
          has some minor problems which Joe talked them through when the
          system was brought up.  This call was to find out how to delete
          some files DSKCLN had marked as bad.  The file names were all
          jumbled punctuation characters with a few letters thrown in.

Solution: I checked the ribs and the UFD data pages for errors and found
          everything intact.  Then I renamed all the files except the bad
          ones into OSNF and deleted *.* to remove the weird file names.
          I restored the files to BASELINE and told operations to restore
          from the all-files and incrementals anything that was lost.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, System 74.

Problem:  System crashed with no CTY output during the ASP restore.

Solution: Initially told operations that there should be no reason that
          they could NOT continue the restore at the beginning of the
          current tape.  Talked to Osman and found that the reason for
          the rebuild was that they were having problems since the head
          crash earlier this week.  I called operations back and told
          them that it would be better to restart the restore from tape
          one, to insure that everything was in order.

Contact:  Cupertino Operation, (408)446-7705, David J., System C70.
Problem:  System crashed twice during ALL-FILES.
Solution: Found reason of crashes to be the bad file in user name
          (NETDATA)MCRF.OCT, just like system C26 was when it was
          running with 2meg of memory. But system C70 is running
          with 1meg of memory now. Hmmmmmm????

23-Oct-86 22:30/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2589, Mike, System F28
Problem:  Incrementing hard read errors, on one particular cylinder.  FSC
          checked the drive, OK, problem moved when pack was moved.
          They already copied out this pack once today, this new duplicate
          has its own set of bad spots.  Note: They were unable to copy the
          pack on F28, and did it on F40 (an IBM system) instead.
          FNDBAD reported 3 files with HRE.
Solution: Told them to rename the files to *.BAD and restore good copies from
          tape.  The files are now (NETSTAT)61014A.BAD, (SRA)PSPDAT.BAD, and
          (MSNTRACK)DUNS.BAD.  The file in NETSTAT is 10978 pages long.
Remark:   I will write a program tomorrow to free up all except the bad pages.

Contact:  Fremont Operation, (415)794-2588, Rick D., System F28.
Problem:  Many WRTSAT and BADSAT, coused by fleaky memory and

Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7435, Greg Moran, D34
Problem:  PAM not running, (UTIL)GOPJ would not start it.
Diagnosis: Tried "TAUX PJ:34" from system 34, got "?access barred".
          This means that D34's base (node 6703) is not in the list of
          TYMSHARE nodes.  The supervisor says 6703 is not in the class list
          valid for PJ.
Fix:      Logged into D23, set AC license, "R (SPL)TAUX" and "PJ:34".
          This is a temporary hack until Validations adds node 6703 to list.

Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, L.T. Smith, System C24 alias C70
Problem:  BADSAT, [1,1].UFD messed up, etc. when doing RESTORE of C70's files.
          One of the disks had gone off-line, reports of BADSAT on other disks.
Diagnosis: Ran TSTSUP, word 25 of page 1 pointed to [1,1].UFD RIB at page 20712.
          Word 51 of that page pointed to UFD data page for hash 0, it was
          200006,,000012 - the first non HOM page on DSKB3.  That particular
          page was full of ASCII text, TYMSAT engine code in particular.
          Something crumped on the SAT for DSKB3 again allowing the Monitor
          to write over (UFD) again.
Fix:      Turned off RBREAL in RIB pointer (making it 6,,12).  Told operations
          to run another FULL DSKCLN, restore the UFD section of the tape again,
          and resume restoring from where they left off.
Followup: As of noon Friday, TITO was in the middle of restoring (MOORING).
          System uptime 9:35.  PSP reports 952145 pages free, no errors.
2-Oct-86 04:06/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, L.T. Smith, System C24
Problem:  He refreshed the disks on 24, and started restoring all files from
          C70's backup tapes.  TITO restored all UFDs, all of SYS, then died
          with stopcode IME in the middle of directory BAILEY on the first tape.
Diagnosis: This happens on all systems - after REFRESH, there is a limited
          number of SATs that can be kept in core and none are written out.
          When the last in-core SAT is filled up, the system dies with IME,
          and you have to run a FULL DSKCLN.  Then the operator has to get
          ALL license (without using REFLAG!) and resume restoring.

Fix:      I ran TSTSUP (it and DECDDT are on SYS on all systems as of 25-Sep)
          and found that page 0 of [1,1].UFD had been overwritten with garbage.
          Probably when the monitor stepped all over itself when the SATs
          filled up.  Told LT to do the following:
          1. Get a directory of the all-files tape to find where SYS ends
          2. Refresh DSKB again
          3. Restore from tape positions 1-<end of SYS>
          4. Run BOOTS to write BOOT.KI to home pages
          5. Take the system down
          6. Bring up the system and run a FULL DSKCLN
          7. Find someone who has an OPER name with all license
          8. Finish restoring rest of all-files

          TELECOPY reports "SYSTEM ERROR".  At least 1 hard device error
          was noticed before the problem occurred.
Fix:      Told them to try a FAST DSKCLN to see if (SYS).UFD is wiped out.
          They ran TAKEIT with no problems, system came up OK.
          The in-core database must have gotten corrupted.

Problem:  Went down with IME, got HOME PAGE WRITE ERROR.  Tried again without
          checking out the disk drive, but this caused NOWRIT stopcode and
          INCONSISTANT PACK-SET ID.  LT called (415)495-3891 - got "number has
          been disconnected".  Called (415)794-2567 - no answer after 6 rings.
          Then he called my home phone number I had given Tuesday when my
          beeper was not working.
Fix:      Told operator how to JFCL out OLDST5-2 in ONCDSK.
          Told them the TXS beeper is (415)495-3841 (not 91) and that the

          phone, he was out of town.  I received the message when I came to work
Problem:  System 26 went down several times with MAPAL1, some proceeded by work.
          INFO stopcode BADSAT.

Problem:  Disk errors HDEV on many different disks.
Fixed:    Hardware and "inconsistant pack set ID"
New problem:  (SYS).UFD wiped out.  Other UFDs OK.
Second alarm:  At 08:00 called Joe Smith to see if it was possible to
          salvage the disk without doing a full rebuild.

Problem:  When logged in REFLAG, could not access files on SYS, but
          could RUN TSTSUP[3,213211].  The HOME page were OK, but the
          RIB to [1,4].UFD was not.  Word 23 of page 1 pointed to page 1023.
          That page was a RIB, but instead of saying [1,4].UFD it said
          090586.SAT[6,270]. The self-pointer (word 777 of the RIB) was for
          200010,,14573. The Monitor wrote good data to the wrong spot on
          the disk.

Cure:     Using the RIB to SYS on C34 as a guide, I rebuilt the RIB by hand
          in page 1023.  Only 4 of the 14 data pages of [1,4].UFD could be
          located.  Pages 1017, 1020, 1021, and 1022, which contained entries
          for SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS, SWAP.SYS, and CRASH.SYS respectively.  After
          verifying the RIBs for those files, I zeroed the last word on the 4
          UFD data pages, and put dummy entries for the missing 3 UFD RIB
          pointers.  I also had to update the copy of this disk page that the
          Monitor had mapped in core (luckily it was within the first 256K
          where FILDDT could find it).  At this point, 4/14 of the SYS
          directory was accessable, including DSKCLN but not INITIA or LOGINN.
          Running DSKCLN in CHECK mode verified that the disk was good with
          many thousand lost pages (from the unaccessable files that were
          on SYS). I poked on 1,,600000 in the STATES word so that DSKCLN would
          fix the UFDs and SATs.  Ran TITO to restore (SYS)*.* with
          MODE SYS NEWEST.  System up to users at 17:29.

Problem:  Many HDEV's on drive, Operation took system down to run
          full DSKCLN. After dskcln finished, dskcln could not write
          SAT table to disk.

Solution: Copied out the pack which was getting HDEV errors. System
          still wouldn,t come up, fails with same message as above.
          Asked T/M to check the drives. T/M found the bad drive and
          system up with full dskcln. Had many bad files.

Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7436, Jim English, System D65.

Problem:  System crashed with WRTSAT. When the system was brought back
          up, it would complain "BPA3 SECOND HOME/BAT PAGES READ ERROR"
          and all the units after that "MISSING OR INCONSISTAND PACK
          SET ID" BPA4, BPA5, BPA6, BPA7.

Solution: Called in to KLINIK line and try to bring the system up
          manualy through tymnet and consule w/o succes. Asked operator
          to copy out the pack BPA3. Could not copy out the pack. Then
          wanted to make sure that drive was OK and I was getting ready
          to run SA10 diagnostic on it but operator could not get the
          drive to come ready with a scratch pack on, turned system
          over to meintenance.
          Continue..
          Maintenance found a bad R/W head (#1) and replaced it. Afte
          that all it needed to be fix was "MISSING OR INCONSISTAND
          PACK SET ID". It is fix and system started to run full
          DSKCLN OK.

Contact:  Fremont Operation, (415)498-2588, Brad, System F58.

Problem:  Stopcode CRASH with nonzero in LH of 30, no other indications.
          When attempting to boot SYSTEM from disk, KL hangs, no activity
          visible at memory box.  BOOTS cannot find NEWMON, OLDMON, or BACKUP.
          When F58-P034/P-12 is loaded from tape, TYPE ALL shows that it can
          read the HOM pages of all disks, but system hangs or gets stopcode.
          Rick Daniels notified, interpreted TYPE ALL as meaning CPU, memory,
          and disk controller OK, and called Software Support instead of
          Maintenance (Ruben was working on F30 from 11:30 to 6:00).

Action:   Since one of the stopcodes was MAPAL1, I the operator set DDT
          breakpoint with "1 Control-B".  It stopcoded at CHTFNU+7 instead of
          MAPAL1.  Went to Solar Way, could not get it to stop at MAPAL1.
          The stopcode at CHTFNU (in routine REMCHT) implied that bits and
          pieces of the PGY table were getting zeroed.  DDT could not open
          symbol table for CORE1, COMMON, and others.  At one breakpoint, DDT
          looped trying to type out symbolic address.  Spent a couple hours
          chasing red herrings, but learned interesting things about PGYTAB.

          Called in Maintenance.  Diagnostics called out port contention
          problems with memory, DTE byte transfer failure, and page failure
          in PXCT 4,[DBP AC,XXX].  Left Solar way at 20:05.

          Lenny reported CPU problem fixed.  DSKCLN ran to completion, but PSP
          reports 457511 pages free (should have been 75,000).  A few files are
          missing in many directories, in particular, (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO,
          (SPL)TURNUP, (MPL)TYPER, (XEXEC)MEXEC.

Problem:  UIL stopcode with memory errors.  Deselected sector of memory, then
          got "Inconsistant Hash Constant" and "Too many last logical units"
          and "Logical unit NN missing from DSKB" where NN went from 1 to 89.

Solution: Went on-site set breakpoints and check the home pages.  DSKB11(300209)
          messed up.  Of the 24 data words in the HOM page, all but 5 were
          zero.  The check for missing logical units gets into an infinite loop
          if HOMLUN does not match HOMLOG.  Patched the HOM page on BPA13.
          Came up in CONSOL mode, ran DSKCLN in CHECK mode.  It complained that
          unit 9 was missing RIB pointers.  Put them in using (SPL)FILDDT.
          DSKCLN ran on in check mode, recycled and ran FULL DSKCLN at 8:30.
          Elapsed time 3 hours to avoid doing a system rebuild.

Problem:  This is a "MEMOREX 3650 DISK SYSTEM".
          Operation was doing a scheduled "PACK ADD" and couldn't
          format the pack which they were trying to add.

Solution: The drive they were trying to format was not in NATIVE
          mode. After putting it in native mode, still couldn.'t
          formatted. This drive should have been OK, becouse I had
          a one pack test system on it. But maintenance was using
          it as a scratch pack to check the new SA-10 in last couple
          of weeks. I don't know what realy happend but looks like
          this is the case where pack needs to be formated with SA10
          diagnostic first before PAKCP5 will format it. Since this is
          a KL10 system and don't have SA10 diagnostic running on it
          yet give the operation one other one pack test system drive.
          Help operation to do add pack.

          Regular crash, Vijay called because note saying to call the hotline
          for any crash in 26 was not removed.  Had them reload from SYSTEM.SAV,
          this portion of testing 26XP33 is over.

30-Jul-86 05:14/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operation, (408)446-7705, Tom, System C26.

Reason:   The plans were to leave 26 running P034/P33 monitor with instructions
          to call the hotline if the machine crashed (to get a dump if the
          "hang" problem occurred).  The hang has been fixed, but the notice to
          call the hotline was not cancelled.  26XP33 crashed with SIMUUF
          stopcode.  COPYCRASH appears to not have saved the dump, but the
          CTY output for this crash is identical to the SIMUUF that happened at
          09:55 on 29-Jul from P034/P19-4.

Problem:  System crshing with APRFAT while running TITO.

Solution: Found a bad file in (BILLING10)070186.SAT causing the crash.
          System would crash with FILAUS before but now it is crashing
          with APRFAT. APRSTS shows NXM and MB parity error. We need to
          look into these crashes little closer.

          I could not delete the bad file (BILLING10)070186.SAT. I asked
          the operator to continiue TITO after user name BILLING10
          untill I found a way to delete the bad file.

Solution: Told them to just follow their procedure for setting the date.
          The date & time is gotten from the network, and BUBBNET was
          most probably at fault.

Problem:  F38 continues to get SIMUUF stopcodes.  Twice it has been 4 times
          in a row, followed by a COMCON:KILUP1.  It isn't apparent what is
          causing the problem, but it is reasonable to believe that KILUP1+3
          is caused by the SIMUUF problem.

Solution: None.  Told operations to reload and come up normally.  That there
          wasnt much that we could do about the problem without a lot of
          research into SIMUUF.  We need to spend some time on this.

Problem:  Head crash.  They were unable to copy-out the old pack and did not
          have enough disks to build a new DSKB on a new set of packs.  They
          wanted permission from Software Support to copy over the existing
          set.  This will destroy any further chances of salvaging data if
          the ASP rebuild fails, but they just do not have any more 3330
          disks.

Solution: Permission granted.  It's nice to see that they asked.

Callback: 05:40 Vijay wanted to know if it was OK to use the P-5 monitor to
          rebuild the system since they did not have C36-P034/P-10 on any
          of the bootable monitor tapes.

Problem:  Incrementing hard device errors on one pack.  Could not copy pack
          with PAKCOP - too many data check errors on many different spots.
          (Problem appears to have been caused by yesterday's power failure.)
          Copied pack on an IBM 370, the copy causes "device check for job 1"
          when system is brought up.  System runs with old pack, although
          users complain about damaged files.

Solution: Agreed to Jim's suggestion that he come up with old pack until they
          could schedule a system rebuild.

07:42     Rick Daniels called me at home, to verify that a system rebuild was
          necessary (he expected it was).

Symptom:  System crashes attempting all-files with TITO.  Last user done
	  was (BETATESTINT).  Assumption was that a file in BETATESTINT
	  was bad.  Checked with Osman since similar problem occurred on
	  13-Apr-86, system 26.

Problem:  File 041486.SAT in (BILLING10) was bad.  File could be looked
	  at, but not read completely.  CKSUM and copy failed & crashed
	  the system.

	  Examined file with TSTSUP.  File has a hole in it an otherwise
	  appears to be normal.  These files should not have holes in them!
	  Apparently something is deleting a page without updating all the
	  proper file-system tables and thus a hole in this file seems to
	  be causing a crash.

Solution: The file was marked bad by hand using TSTSUP and this prevents
	  TITO from attempting to put it on tape.  The file was renamed to
	  (CRASH:26) for further examination.

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone
        number.

Symptom:  DSKCLN stopcode FILUUO(042522) at FUNM+6 reading LUD.SYS[1,4]
          Ran FULL DSKCLN, it reported "FILE 1,1.UFD[1,1] BAD DATA IN RIB"

Action:   Brought up system MANUAL, ran DSKCLN in check mode, no errors.
          Brought up system to run FULL DSKCLN, got BAD DATA again.
          Brought up system READONLY, ran TSTSUP, RIB looks fine.
          Set 1B17 in STATES, tried running DSKCLN, system answered.

Symptom:  System dies in ONCE complaining about unit 15 off-line due to hardware
          errors, logical unit 5 missing from DSKB.  Operations called for
          software support in case problem was the same as "inconsistent pack
          set id".

Problem:  Advised them that problem sounded like hardware, and to try to the
          disk on a different drive.  Hardware called in.

Solution: Drive had a bad plug.  System answered at 18:49.

Contact:  Cupertino BLDG C OPS, Jeannine, (408)446-7705, System 55

Symptom:  BPA4 Hang during All-Files storing (FTMAGNUM)MGRG.HGH.
          Even moving pack from one drive to another didn't resolved
          the problem. Couldn't copy the file, hangs the drive.

Problem:  File (FTMAGNUM)MGRG.HGH was marked bad (HRE). Problem is
          either a bad spot on pack and/or a bad file.

Solution: Renamed file (FTMAGNUM)MGRG.HGH to (FTMAGNUM)MGRG.BAD
          and asked operator to restore the file from All-Files,
          since the creation date on the file was Aug 31,83.
27-May-85 05:25/Carl (via Craig)
Contact:  Cupertino BLDG C OPS, Tom, (408)446-7705, System 36

Symptom:  In trying to rebuild system 36's disk, the FILES command:
          "CHANGE SWAP" was unrecognized by the monitor.

Problem:  None.  All references to "SWAPPING" have been removed from
          the operating system as of the P034/L release.  Apparently the
          current mini-manuals still reflect the commands as of P034/K.
          The current rebuild was being done by P034/N10.

Solution: None required.  Tom had continued the restore while awaiting
          an answer from software support.  I called Tom and explained
          that the SWAPPING commands were gone and no longer needed and
          that everything was proceeding correctly.  He plans to check
          the software release memos and let me know if this tidbit of
          information just slipped through the cracks.

12-May-85 16:20/Carl
Contact:  Cupertino OPS, Mike (408)446-7705, System C36

Symptom:  DSKCLN would not run, --NO LUD--, many rib errors were
          reported on BPA3: (E1), pack moved to (C2) but system
          would not come up, DSKCLN et al.

Problem:  Initial drive (E1) suspect.  System scheduled for TM this
          midnight for checkout of all drives involved.  Rib errors
          caused (SYS)LUD.SYS to be clobbered.

Solution: Brought system up MANUAL with REFLAG/-1 and DSKCLN ran ok
          in checking mode, reported LUD bad and MFD page use count
          incorrect.  Restored (SYS)LUD.SYS and brought system up.
          Returned system to CUPC OPS and haven't heard further of
          any other major errors.
06-May-85 01:00/Osman & Carl
Contact:  Cupertino BLDG A Operation, (408)446-6301, System C22

Symptom:  System crashes with EXCMPE every couple of hours and
          TELECOPY wouldn't work.

Problem:  Problem is not solved yet but identified after spending
          many hours to isolate it. Problem appears to be a system
          configuration mis-match like FCWDS, RPORTN etc. numbers
          not beeing correct. System would crash with /N10 cut for
          C22 and old V22 /K-13 monitor.

Solution: System running OK with C34's /K-15 monitor untill we cut
          a /N10 monitor with the correct configuration.

Symptom:  Most everything comes out of ttys had garbage.

Problem:  System was seeing two BPA0 ID plug, should have been
          BPA0 & BPA3. After fixing BPA problem system was still
          out putting garbage. Tried recycling the system but it
          would die with "Boots loaded" right after start running
          DSKCLN, suspected hardware problem. Turned over to
          Maintenance to check the hardware.

Solution: Maintenance found a bad CPU module and drive. System
          up without any problem.

Contact:  Cupertino OPS, L.T. Smith (408)446-7705, System C26

Symptom:  BAD SAT After running FULL DSKCLN.

Problem:  Earlier BPA10 was hung, OPS tried to pop the ID plug
          to get the system going, but wasn't successful. So took
          system down to run FULL DSKCLN and got the message
          BAD SAT don't bring system up for users.

Solution: Ran DSKCLN in checking mode was OK, then ran DSKCLN in
          Fixing mode was OK also. What ever the problem with the
          Disk drive (BPA10) is gone.

Symptom:  LOGINN.SHR file found bad by DSKCLN, can't login.

Problem:  File (SYS)LOGINN.SHR was bad by DSKCLN.  Needs to be
          restored from the last all files tape via TITO.

Solution: Bring system up setting REFLAG and coming up MANUAL.
          This give the first job to login all the license, then
          the file can be restored by TITO.

Contact:  Cupertino OPS, Steve C. (408)446-7705, System C34

Symptom:  Can't set oper status.

Problem:  File (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO didn't have WC license.
          Every time (SSPAMBIN)PSWUPD ran to update the DRWSPR.EPO
          file it would take the WC license from it.

Solution: Gave WC license to (SSPAMBIN)PSWUPD, it only had WF before.

Contact:  Dallas OPS, Tyrone Hill, (214)637-7435, System 54.

Symptom:  Could not LOGIN.   (LOGINN.SAV not found).

Problem:  Received some SAT and RIB failure messages on the CTY and
          started having problems.  Had TCM Dallas look at the hardware
          and found a bad controller.  Fixed problem and system could
          not run DSKCLN, could not LOGIN in MANUAL mode.
          Apparently, the disk structure was destroyed somehow, SYS
          and other directories, probably even the MFD were clobbered.
          The system appeared as if a REFRESH was done.

Solution: Had OPS rebuild the system from the last night's ASP tapes and
          that day's incremental backup tapes.

Contact:  Valley Forge Operation,??????,(215)666-9663,System V22.

Symptom:  After an error from source pack, Pakcopy will hang.

Problem:  Scratch on pack such that Pakcopy can't read to continue.
          This is just a guest.

Solution: Suggested to do an ASP dump first and then swap the bad pack
          and rebuild system from ASP.
13-Oct-84 22:50 /Carl
Contact:  Dallas OPS, Lynda Burke, (214)637-7435, System 65.

Symptom:  Job (PJ)PAM would not run.  It was started again and again
          throughout the entire last shift.  Every time, it would log
          itself out after about 5 minutes with no apparent reason.

Problem:  File (PJ)JOB001.HGH had a RIB error.  PAM could not run the
          job and thus logged itself out without any proper notification
          of any problem.  (This ought to be fixed!!!)

Solution: Tried running (UTIL)GOPJ which is the same procedure followed
          by operations.  Same result.  Logged in as PJ and immediately
          found a RIB error on file (PJ)JOB001.HGH which is one of the
          numerous "jobs" that PAM periodically runs.  Deleted the file
          with DIRIT ["Delete (PJ)JOB001.HGH/BAD"] and called operations
          to have them restore the file from the last all-files tape.

13-Oct-84 19:55 /Carl
Contact:  Dallas OPS, Doug Corrales, (214)637-7435, System 56.

Symptom:  System hung.  98% Frecor shown as used, kept getting the
          message "?TTYnnn not available" when attempting to LOGIN.

Problem:  Ran out of free core on the system.  System HUNG as above.

Solution: Called Dallas OPS and specified directly that a core dump
          was to be taken when the system reload was attempted.  (Was
          informed later that no dump was taken!)  They brought the
          system up on /K and sent mail saying that the system would
          be brought up on /N after sunday morning's ASP dump.

13-Oct-84 9:11 /Carl (was paged at 11:00)
Contact:  CUPC OPS, LT Smith, (408)446-7705, System 57.

Symptom:  System file was garbled after completion of ASP restore.
          The file was marked with a HRE and needed to be restored
          from tape.  However, the file bad file didn't go away.

Problem:  File FORDDT.HLP somehow got garbled and was restored from
          tape.  The old file named FORD$T.??? still exists and cannot
          be deleted by OPER.  Needs attention.

Solution: Logged in and cleaned up the file and the directory.  Sent
          mail to OPER describing what was done.

13-Oct-84 8:40 /Carl (was paged at 11:00)
Contact:  Fremont OPS, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, Batch System errors.

Symptom:  Error messages printed out on batch terminal during the past
          two shifts.  Cannot get any batch request information.

Problem:  probably a 940 batch system problem with SLVSUP or something
          else.  Not a PDP-10 operating system problem.

Solution: I told Bonnie to call BLDG A and ask the 940 operators to
          check things out.  This is not a PDP-10 problem and I should
          not have been called in the first place.

13-Oct-84 4:30 /Carl
Contact:  Dallas OPS, Roy, (214)637-7435, System 56.

Symptom:  System down unexpectedly.

Problem:  System had crashed.  The wrong monitor was loaded by the
          operator, so they took the system back down to reload the
          correct monitor.

Solution: Operator Error, nothing to do.  System back up running the
          current monitor, P034/N until further notice.

01-Oct-84 8:15 /Carl
Contact:  Dallas OPS, Tom Marconi (214)637-7435, System 56.

Symptom:  Cannot log in.  JOB CAPACITY EXCEEDED message from the
          monitor with less than 17 jobs on the system.  In fact,
	  logging a job out does not allow another to log in.

Problem:  Monitor was patched incorrectly to restrict the number
          of logins.  The patch was intended to replace the
	  AOBJN pointer [-jobs,,1] with [-70,,1] and was installed
	  incorectly as [70,,1] ... OOPS.

Solution: Tom Marconi was directed as to how to patch the running
          monitor correctly.  Using OSMAN's OPER password, MARCONIT
	  patched the correct location to [-70,,1].  The system was
          then back to normal.

24-Sep-84 8:15 /Osman, 9:15 /Carl
Contact:  Operations CUPA, (408)446-6301, System C897.

Symptom:  Cannot bring system up.  DSKCLN reports bad HOM page in
          the file HOME.SYS on unit 1.  Same message occurrs when
          running DSKCLN in checking mode.

Problem:  Actual problem may have been a bad copy of DSKCLN.  When
          a fresh copy of DSKCLN was tried, the problem disappeared.
          Trying the (SYS) copy again produced the problem.

Solution: [Referred problem to Carl, to check HOME.SYS with TSTSUP].
          Replaced the (SYS) copy with the new copy and reloaded the
          system from tape.  [BOOTS from disk still not working!]
          Had operations run a FULL DSKCLN, no other reported errors.

Symptom:  System crashed with APA2 Hang massege, tried to
	  bring the system up 2 or 3 times got the same
	  massege.

Problem:  TCM found drive 2 to be bad and had to replace the
	  unit. Of course  replacing the unit required rebuilding
	  the system from All Files tapes.

Solution: Replaced disk drive unit 2 and formated the pack.
	  Rebuild system from all file tapes.
22-Sep-84 11:40 /Carl
Contact:  Bonnie (415)498-2588, System F74.
          Dennis Moulton (408)730-0282.

Symptom:  Directory, Rename and Delete commands for username (COLNET)
          produce an INSUFFICIENT CORE message.

Problem:  DIRIT runs out of low-seg memory while building the internal
          tables necessary for doing directory/file functions.  The real
          problem is that the use has too many file in his directory for
          DIRIT to handle.  Fix is to re-link DIRIT as lowseg only using
          DEC's LINK program and the /SEG:LOW switch (or :.low. ???).

Solution: First performed an UNDELETE/PURGE command to see if there
          were any .TMP files "soft-deleted" by DIRIT.  This got rid
          of 30,000+ pages and lots of files.  DIRIT now worked on
	  this user's directory and I logged off.  LOGOUT took 2 1/2
	  hours to delete almost 8,000 .TMP files which hadn't been
          deleted previously.  UNDELETE took 1/2 hour to purge the
	  first set, so a total of 2 hours spend deleting files has
	  solved this problem.

Contact:  Mike Suds (408)446-7705, System 33.

Symptom:  Could not change "network password" for username OPER.
          PASSWORD version 40 kept returning with a timeout while
          waiting for response from the CUD.

Problem:  This is really a network problem, not a TYMCOM-X problem.
          The CUD is on system 1, and either something is wrong with
          the MUD/CUD interface or the system (1) is just running
          too slow.  Anyway, there's nothing we can do to solve the
          problem.

Solution: Have them call BLDG A and check on any problems with system 1,
          and/or call their manager, Gary Perez, to decide what to do.

Contact:  Bill Wood(314)895-2503, Mallinckrodt, System 169.

Symptom:  Failure running Magnum job.

Solution: Looked for disk errors and bad files etc. Couldn't find
	  anything wrong but magnum still failed. Suggested
	  recycling the system with FULL DSKCLN. After DSKCLN
	  ran everything is OK.


21-Aug-84 04:25 /Carl
Contact: Fred Llyod, CUPC, System 36 (408) 446-7705

Symptom:  Operations brought the system up forcing a FAST DSKCLN
          and received the error message from DSKCLN:

            File 1,1.UFD[1,1] read error for RIB
            Critical file damage, etc.

          I ran DSKCLN in checking mode and it reported problems
              on drives 0 and 3 - RIB ERROR
              on drive 0 - BAD RETRIEVAL POINTER

Problem:  Memory was cousing the problem.

Solution: After memory was fixed, Ran full DSKCLN, got bunch of bad
          files deleted and restored files, all OK after that.

12-Aug-84 17:00 /Osman
Contact:  Paul Miller (Dallas), System 25 (214) 637-7435

Symptom:  System keeps crashing during the rebuild from ALL FILES.

Problem:  Possable memory problem and/or procedurel problem.
	
Solution: While talking with operator to isolate the problem, T/M
          decited to reconfigure memory and restart rebuild from
          start. Everything was OK after that.

12-Aug-84 13:40 /Carl (responded to 12:30ish call)
Contact:  L.T. (CUPC), System 29 x7705

Symptom:  ASP gives "DSKCLR ERROR" message and will not permit an ASP
          dump to be taken.

Problem:  ASP / Monitor was changed sometime during /L development to
          disallow a simple DSKCLR and then an ASP dump in order to make
          sure the file structure, et al is intact.  This forces a reload
          before an ASP dump can be performed.

Solution: Have operations change their procedures.  Reload and come up
          under MANUAL before starting the ASP dump.


06-Jul-84 14:00 /Osman
Contact:  Mike Stubb (CUPC), System 26 x7705

Symptom:  System hung in accounting wait due to CHKPNT failure.

Problem:  CHKPNT failure, accounting shutting down due to running out
          of disk space.  CHKPNT never restarts accounting once it stops.

Solution: Recycle the system.  (Restarted CHKPNT)

Status:   Completed by Osman.


03-jul-84 9:00 /Osman
Contact:  Jeannine (CUPC) x7705, ref system 33

Symptom:  Can't run DSKCLN, Can't login.
          ?Initialization failure job DSKCLN NO LUD
          ?LOGINN not found.
	  ?SYSTAT not found.

Problem:  (SYS)LUD.SYS had been clobbered and needed to be restored.
	  Due to air-conditioning problems, some disk problems seem
	  to have caused "device errors" on a few files. (DISK went
	  off-line, etc.)  SYSTAT.SHR, RPG.SHR, LOGINN.SHR seemed
	  bad, but after a full DSKCLN, only LUD.SYS and SYSTAT had
	  to be replaced.

Solution: Restore LUD.SYS and telecopy SYSTAT.SHR from another system.

Status:   Completed by Osman. (Telephone help from Carl).


03-July-84 8:48 /Wilkes
Contact:  Jeannine Reid, CUPC Operations, system 33

Symptom:   Disk BPA4 off line.  brought system down and moved pack
	   to another drive.  Tried to bring system up and run full
	   dskcln.  loses.  gives error message: initialization failure
	   job dskcln no lud.  brought system up manual, could not login
	   due to no lud.

Solution:  ??????????

Status:	   hardware folks have machine to run diagnostics as of
	   9:00 Tues 3-july-84   i will try to find Osman or Carl.

14-Jun-84 21:30 /Lois
Contact:  Debbie Hightower, CUPC Operations, ref system 24

Symptom:  No one can log into 24, get "frame capacity exceeded" even
          though only OPER is logged in

Solution: (temporary) had them "fall back" to the K-10 in backup.sav
          which, of course, fixed the immediate problem.  This needs
          further investigation as to possible L relation

Status:   Fixed by operations reloading as advised.


11-Jun-84 12:00 /Lois (passed to Carl)
Contact:  Ken Brinton (St. Louis), system 169 "MA" /L21

Problem:  System times out after approx 1-2 minutes and falls through
          the PICON timeout check which Dave Sutton added.  When this
          code is patched out with DDT, the system hangs instead.

Symptom:  The system will not stay up long enough to do anything, and
          due to a head crash which started this whole ordeal, there
          isn't even a file system to blame.  All indicators point to
          the hardware, but DEC affirms that they cannot find anything
          wrong.

Status:   Two new tapes /K with/without a printer have been  shipped to
          the site.  More later.

11-Jun-84 10:00 /Lois
Contact:  Brad; Fremont Operations, ref system 30

Symptom:  SYSTAT commands give ?TRANSMISSION ERROR

Solution: Copied (sys)systat.shr and (sys)systat.low to same file names
          (after setting license).  (This shouldn't have been a hot line
          call!)

Status:   Fixed by Lois, mail to OPER


10-Jun-84 21:16 /wilkes
contact:  Cindy @dallas operations 214/637-7433  system 23

symptom:  ?loginn not found

problem:  system 23 apparently had disk prblems earlier, hardware - lost
	  a pack, or something.  At any rate, there is no file system
	  out there.  Operator is trying to bring system up to do an ASP
	  restore  (bringing up "reflag"), but is unable to do so.

solution: Operator claims to have followed procedure for starting a
	  restore, and that it loses.  Hardware fault or operator
	  error suspected.

status:	  Hardware maintenance personnel on premises. 11-Jun-84 20:32

follow-up: all-files restore done sunday night (10-jun).   as of 8:36
	   11-Jun-84 (monday) the system was up and running.  I called
	   Dallas at 8:00 monday morning (11-jun) and was informed that
	   the problem was that the operator did not know the procedure
	   for an ASP restore.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A HOT-LINE
	   CALL!  /wilkes

05-Jun-84 14:00 /Carl
Contact:  Gary Perez; Debbie @ Operati x7705, ref system 897

Symptom:  The LIST command in SETOP reports 3-5 entries then gives
          a complaint about an inconsistancy in the password file
          and exits to EXEC level.  LIST command from top level in
          SETOP (OPER name <CR>) shows all of the people managed
          by PEREZG (CUPA,CUPC et al) without any problems.

Solution: Since there was a question of the integrity of the file
          (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO, I had them restore another copy of the
          file from system 33.

Status:   Completed by operations between 4:30 & 5:30pm.


02-Jun-84 22:40 /Carl
Contact:  Mike Silva, x6301,  ref system 897

Symptom:  System 897, initialization failure with INITIA.

Problem:  ?Initialization failure job DSKCLN NO LUD

          (SYS)LUD.SYS had the wrong protection and thus could not be
          read by INITIA at system startup.

Solution: File should be protected ALL RD RD.

Status:   Fixed by WRS 04-Jun-84.
