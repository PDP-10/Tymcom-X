The P033 release of the TYMCOM-X monitor  introduces  a  complete,  user
controlled paging facility.  The user can control his address space page
by page, declare a set of pages in  his  address  space  to  be  in  his
"working  set", map pages from files into his address space, and trap on
references to pages not in his working set.

P033 is compatible with  P032  and  earlier  monitors  except  for  some
aspects  of sharable writable high segment function.  However, there are
some user observable differences  between  P033  and  earlier  monitors,
which are outlined below.

     1.  Gettabs for high segments will fail return, since the system no
         longer  keeps  information  about high segments.  high segments
         are just pages mapped into the  user's  address  space  from  a
         .HGH,  .SHR,  or  .SWR  file (see below for information on .SWR
         files).

     2.  The RUN UUO,  RUN  command  and  the  GET  command  remove  the
         previous  contents  of  the  caller's address space following a
         successful lookup of the first file in the file search sequence
         (.SHR,  .HGH,  .SAV,  .SWR).  In P032 and earlier monitors, the
         job's low segment was not removed until  completely  connecting
         to  the  new  high  segment.   This  allowed programs to obtain
         certain error codes from a RUN uuo issued from the low  segment
         which  are  no  longer  available.  In P033, only the "file not
         found" error can be returned from the RUN uuo.  All other error
         conditions  (I/O error, for example) will cause a monitor error
         message and stop the job.

     3.   RUNSEG and GETSEG UUOs  remove  the  old  hiseg  after  having
         successfully  looked  up the new hiseg.  Therefore, errors such
         as "transmission error"  and  "not  enough  core"  can  not  be
         returned to the program if the GETSEG or RUNSEG was issued from
         the old hiseg.  These errors can be returned to the program  if
         the call was issued from the loseg.

     4.  REMAP UUOs issued from a position in the address space which is
         affected  (moved or removed) during execution of the REMAP will
         cause the error message "REMAP UUO failure, VM  space  mangled"
         if the REMAP fails.

     5.  The CORE uuo will  allow  a  low  segment  of  256K.   Monitors
         previous to P033 only allowed 255K.

     6.  Sharable writable high segments work  differently  under  P033.
         Sharable writable high segment programs must be run from a file
         with the extension ".SWR (Sharable WRitable)".  It is no longer
         possible  to expand sharable writable high segments with a CORE
         UUO.  The data format of a .SWR file is identical  to  that  of
         .SHR  files, so it is only necessary to rename a .SHR file to a
         .SWR file in order to allow the program to continue to sharably
         write into itself.

         An important difference between  sharable  writable  hisegs  in
         P033  and  those in earlier monitors is that there is no longer
                                                                  Page 2


         any "swapping copy" of the modified high  segment.   Thus,  any
         changes   made   to   the  sharable  writable  hiseg  are  made
         permanently to the .SWR file.

         Another  important  difference  exists  for  sharable  writable
         hisegs in the new monitor.  If the hiseg originated from a .SWR
         file to which the user did not have  update  priviledges,  then
         the  program  is  made  RUN  ONLY.   If  the  .SWR file has any
         licenses,  the  program  is  always  made  RUN   ONLY,   update
         priviledges  or  not.   All  forms  of "meddling" (performing a
         start  command  with  an  argument,  for  example)   are   thus
         prevented.   This  ensures  that  all  writes by the hiseg into
         itself are under program control.

         Therefore, if you have a sharable writable hiseg program  which
         you RENAME as a .SWR file to run under P033, you will find that
         it is always RUN ONLY (unless it is an  unlicensed  program  in
         your directory).

     7.  A program running with a hiseg obtained from  a  .HGH  or  .SHR
         file  is  always  allowed  to  write  enable and write into its
         hiseg.  Such modifications are not visible to any other user of
         the  hiseg,  and do not cause any change whatsoever to the .HGH
         or .SHR file.  Writing into such a hiseg causes the job to  get
         its  own private writable page, containing the same data as the
         original hiseg page, into which  it  then  writes.   Note  that
         there  is no longer any difference between .HGH and .SHR files.
         In both cases, the hiseg is shared page by page, private copies
         of  the  pages  being  created for a writer when he writes into
         that page.
