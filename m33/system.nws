     Thank you for updating (SPOOL)NODPRI on most CEGI-Tymshare hosts.
 
     I also appreciate your telephone call to explain how you plan to make
     sure that the node mapping functions get updated once a month.

DATE:	28-Jun-85

  TO:	Hank Spencer

FROM:	Dennis Coffey  (Tymcom-X Support)

SUBJ:	Previously proposed software upgrades for Mallinkrodt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Requests for Mallinkrodt's acceptance of the listed software
have been sent.  The following list does not detail the changes in the
new versions.  That information was listed in the requests.

Software	Function
--------	--------
DIRIT		DECLARE, DELETE, DIRECTORY, FILES & RENAME commands.
PIP		COPY command.
FILCOM		DIFFER command.
UNDELE		Provides "soft" (recoverable) file deletes.  (New)
SETOP		Program for managers to validate users for "operator"
		license.
OPPS		Program for users with "operator" license to change
		their license password.
TITO		Program to store individual files, disk to tape, and
		restore files from tape to disk.
ASP		Program to store disk to tape, as structured on disk.



	Your requests to Mallinkrodt for acceptance of upgrades to
Operating System software for their host 169 have gone unanswered.  We
are thus interpreting this as a lack of acceptance.  We are thereby
initiating the process of distributing the referenced software to all
hosts which can use this software, excluding Mallinkrodt's host 169.
This distribution of software will be the only offer of these revision
in the foreseeable future.

	Mallinkrodt has contracted with "Tymshare" (McDonnell-Douglas)
for operating system maintence and upgrades at the cost to them of $1400
per month.  We are attempting to fulfill our portion of this agreement
with this offer of upgrades.  The information we are communicating to
Mallinkrodt about the upgrades may not be sufficient for them to base an
acceptance.  If this is the case, we are most willing to provide what
information they need, if possible.

	If we receive no answer from you before the end of the first
work week in July (i.e., Wednesday, July 3), we will assume that
Mallinkrodt has no need or desire for the upgrades mentioned.

	Further requests for acceptance of other software upgrades will
follow.

	Thank you,
	Dennis

SUBJ:	I have a copy of Fayez Sarofim's contract

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

For your information:  I have, through some research, obtained a copy of
our contract with Fayez.  You have been quite right:  we are contracted
to provide them with software support.  We will do so with as much speed
as is possible, considering the amount of research involved.  

We believe that Fayez is planning to soon change to MAGNUM on a VAX
machine.  If so, they may now be somewhat resistant to changing software
that they have grown quite familiar with--this is the case with our
other 2020 customers.  We recognize that this does not mean they will
not expect software support for their VAX, when delivered.  We are and
will be willing and able to provide them with contracted support.

I hope this memo indicates our clearer understanding of our support
responsibilities.  If I am wrong about their plans to move to a VAX, I
would appreciate clarification.  

Thanks!
