The program MONED, used to make several monitors for general release,
performs the following functions:

1.	Creates a frame in which it runs MONED1 once for each system
	named ## such that the file CONF##.MAC exists.  The default
	general release monitor name is used in each case (see MONED1
	documentation for <ESC>).

2.	Output from the assemblies is recorded in the file MONED.LOG.

3.	Transmittal data such as files, checksums and build instructions
	are output to MONED.XMT.

4.	A list of files is output to MONED.FIL.

When MONED is run, it lists the systems it will make monitors for.
It then asks if it should detach.  (note the program may be attached
to and detached from at any point)
