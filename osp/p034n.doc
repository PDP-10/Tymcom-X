S: Changed the IFCPU and IFNCPU macros to "repeat cpzz" instead of
   "repeat cpzz," so that IFCPU(x),< ... >  would not generate two
   commas.  /CARL 12-28-81

PICON,ONCE: Fixed Typoe of "IFCPU (x),< mumble >,end ..." which should
   have been "IFCPU (x),< mumble > ; end ... "  (Yes, a comma and not
   a semicolon).  /CARL 12-28-81

UUOCON: Fix X macro used in WAYS macro.  Put a "," between the IFB,IFNB
   and the code to be generated.  Also, add missing ")" close-paren to
   the last item in the WAYS macro (fixed undefined symbol).
   /Carl 12-28-81

UUOCON: Removed SEXTERNAL symbol references SYDFTA and SYDMTX and made
   them conditional on non-zero definitions of the configuration symbols
   FTAUN (# of FTA's) and MAGUN (# of MTA's).

UUOCON: Magically transformed .ELINK into .LNKEND for the new MACRO,
   leaving .ELINK alone for the old MACRO %46.

CTYSIM,CIOPR,KMCSER,DR11C,DZKON,ONCE: Removed SEXTERNAL references to
   DZDO,DRDO,KMCDO,DZINI,DRINI,KMCINI,KMCSMN,KMCCMN and made them all
   conditional on IFKMC.  DZDO,DRDO and KMCDO are defined in CTYSIM as
   always.  /CARL 12-28-81

SIMKL,ONCE: Removed SEXTERNAL references to ONCGO,MONDEB,& PATSIZ and
   added the symbol KL$SIM in the simulator which is checked for non-zero
   by ONCE under an IFCPU (KL) conditional.  Code was added to the patch
   code in the simulator to set KL$SIM non-zero.  /CARL 12-29-81

DDT: Commented out the line "SEXTERN OVTAB." in DDT.  This symbol is not
   even referenced once in the source. (OR in *.mac in M33 or MPL) except
   for LOADER.MAC which is only generating a DUMMY location OVTAB. if it
   doesn't exist already (Special case!).  /CARL 12-29-81

Note:  The monitor now has NO S-EXTERNALS in it.  It will now load using
LINK-10.  With the exception of external POINTer references, the monitor
will also assemble under MACRO %53B.   /CARL 12-29-81

COMMON: (UUOCON,FRMSER,COMCON) Moved pointer UPYPSR from UUOCON into
   COMMON and added corresponding pointers USYPSR & UXYPSR for %UPS
   and %UPX.  All 3 are internal and referenced elsewhere at least once.
   /CARL 12-30-81

COMMON: (SCHED1,CORE1,UUOCON,COMCON,PICON,ONCE) Moved pointers from
   literals in many modules into COMMON where the symbols used are defined.
   New symbols are UPYPTx,UPYPXx,USYPTx,USYPXx,UXYPTx and EPYPSx where <x>
   is either "N" or "M" depending upon whether %xxx.N or %xxx.N-1 is used
   as argument to the macros.  /CARL 12-30-81

COMMON,CORE1: Moved macro definition UPTPTR from CORE1 into S so that it
   can be used where necessary.  Moved the only use of it into COMMON with
   the pointers UPYPTx as mentioned above.  Also: *** NOTE *** I changed
   the name of the macro (UPTPTR) to (UPYPTR) so as not to conflict with
   the UPT symbol UPTPTR.  /CARL 12-31-81

COMMOD,CORE1: Moved pointers from literals into COMMOD for their def's
   and created 2 more symbols RB1PNO and BA1NBB which are near to RBYPNO
   and BAYNBB in definition, but not quite!  /CARL 12-31-81

COMMON,MAPIO,CORE1: Defined some more bit masks in COMMON so that less
   polish is needed for adding bit definitions in other modules. New
   symbols: LMMMXW, LMMSUP, LMMRED, LMMRDW for LMAP bit configurations.
   /CARL 12-31-81

COMMOD,FILRIB: More about pointers: RBYUNA, RBYUNR and RBYUNV for getting
   the unit from ATBRIB(P2), DRBRIB(P1) and DEVRIB(F).  /CARL 12-31-81

FRMSER: Changed BYTE (18) arg,0  to XWD arg,0 inside JDSMAC macro to fix E
   errors in the new macro.  comment used to say something about a bug in
   the old MACRO, but it assembles ok with either version at present.  Also
   changed reference to literal to use UXYPSR in COMMON.  /CARL 12-31-81

FILUUO: Fixed [XWD BYTE (5)0 (3)CPRRED (10)1 (8)0 (10)%COW.N+CNVVPN] to
   simply [<CPRRED>B7+1B17+%COW.N+CNVVPN] to work with the new MACRO.
   Macro-46 simply allowed that construct. Amazing!  /CARL 12-31-81

COMMOD,FILFND: Defined SPTNMM to be SPTNME justified to SPNNFE so we don't
   have to play games with externals.  /CARL 12-31-81

ACTSER: Changed the ATB macro to use Xwd rather than BYTE and added
   a ",0" to the end of each line where a 4th argument was wanted.
   Put angle brackets "<>" around constants used in arithmetic with
   an external.  Fixed "Polish too complex" error.  /CARL 12-31-81

COMCON: In JOBKL, delay call to TTYKIL until after returning from KILUPT.
This should prevent job from being rescheduled with TTYTAB(J)=0, which int
turn should prevent any more crashes at SCNSER:STTLK+6.
/DARREN 1-11-82

COMCON: Set Errflg in P3 instead of clearing J to indicate error at COR2+2.
Error happens when CORE command requires hiseg to be deleted.  Problem
was discovered by noticing that SYSTAT followed by CORE 5 (with SY lic)
crashes system.  /TODD 1-19-82

Errcon: Don't set up previous context F when Adrerr is called.  Fixes 
bug that would either crash system or print a bogus device name in

than once for the same disk page; also halfword table OHTCPN for Core Page
Number of disk page entered in OHTTAB.  /DARREN 2-23-82

ONCE:  Modified routines Evaset and Evaclr and added Evahi to allow
	dynamic data structure allocation to start at next pg after
	initial Syssiz.  Previously started at %Min (pg 400).  Evahi
	determines if virtual address has transitioned from below per-
	process area to within or above it.  If it has, it sets Evasiz
	to %Min.  
COMMON, ONCE:  Call Evahi after Evasiz is modified.  Repeat allocation 
	code for a particular data structure if it couldn't fit below pg
	340 and addr wasn't previoulsy above %Min.  /TODD 2-25-82

KSSYM,ONCE: Moved WRHSB from ONCE to KSSYM where it belonged. /Carl 2-Mar-82

ONCE: Removed more literals so that ONCE would assemble for the KS.  The
    Old MACRO %46 would not fold literals on pass 2 tha same as pass 1,
    thus we got "P" errors during assembly.

MAPIO - All the good stuff:
  Add VM kernel routine KMOVPG to "take a page which is currently mapped
    and not part of a file and cause it to be mappable from the specified
    position of a file open on the channel."
  Add routine LOKHPW, called (by KFCRE & KMOVPG) when holding only the
    atomic file lock and needing the write lock to manipulate a slot past
    highest page written (HPW).
  Add entry SWEPRH to SWEEP to sweep file with real holes despite TITO
   crock; modify SWEEP to use VMOVPG if sweeping 1 page (SIMIO case).

ONCDSK: Modified STSREF (REFRESH) to force a call to UPDHOM after the
        refresh is complete.

ONCDSK: Split GETRAN into SETRAN (start timer) and GETRAN (stop timer
        and read number into RANNO) and call both routines whenever
        CMDSCN is called by ONCE or ONCDSK so that the clock is always

        Re-Inserted LSH to zap low order 12 bits in GETRAN since a
        KL always returns 0 [Inside IFCPU(KL)].
Note: REFSTR rewrites the HOM pages before it returns to ONCDSK, so
      no other forced rewrites are necessary in ONCE.
      /CARL 5-7-82

ONCDSK:  Fixed CMDSCN routine to skip return on "NO" answer to the
         "are you sure" question, so that it doesn't complain about
         commands which require verification as "unrecognized".
ONCDSK:  Added local symbol CMDMSG which if non-zero will only type
         the "Are you sure" question on verification rather than the
         verbose help text put in for operators to read.  Mainly for
         debugging use when jumping in and out of ONCE/ONCDSK.

Common, Clock1, Uuocon:
   Add Inactivity Timeout feature.  New job table, JBTINA, keeps track
of user specified inactivity timeout (0 if off), time since job was
last active, and whether the inactivty limit was hit.  Once-a-minute code
in Clock1 increments inactivity counters.  If the time-limit is hit, the
process will be evicted if enabled for eviction otherwise it will be
hung (killed regardless of hang/zap action specified by user).  Changing
the timeout limit is accomplished with the SET AUTOLOGOUT n command,
SET NOAUTOLOGOUT command, SETPRV UUO with bit 2000 set as desired
(if old Jbtprv 2000 XOR new Jbtprv 2000 = 1 then limit is updated) to set/
clear a timeout of 15 min., and CALLI ac,-146 where ac is limit in min.
Gettab -55 has been added to read the Jbtina word.

   New hang flag, (1B13), causes job to be hard killed without detaching.
Needed so that Logout can print message when autologout occurs.

FRMSER: Fixed misplaced flag in /K41 edit.  STARCL belongs on the
        CCL vector rather than the normal start vector for the
        .FOSVA frmop.   /CARL 2-4-83

ONCE - Split EVASET into two routines, so that high-seg page map set-up
and setting the lower boundary for EVM allocation can be done at different
points in ONCE.  The new routine EVMINI can be called more than once to
allow for the perversities of the FILES subsystem.  /DARREN 2-9-83

SEGCON, ERRCON - Fix old "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message to type out "I/O
error on file FILNAM.EXT".  /DARREN 2-9-83

CORE1 - Remove context page lock/unlock debug code, since problems seem
to be fixed.  /DARREN 2-9-83

/K44
----

SCNSER: added code to TATUUO (ATTACH UUO) and RETACH (UUO) to allow
user to specify forcing target frame to RUN state if not already so,
by calling SETRUN.  This may not make sense with certain other options
specified.  In particular, in RETACH, it will only work when the port
being moved is being attached as the command port.  The option is
selected as follows:
    bit 1B15 in the AC of an ATTACH UUO
    bit 1B4 in the bits field of a RETACH UUO argument block

ONCDSK - When setting up for REFRESH, insure that RANHOM is non-zero before
  calling RWRHOM to re-write home pages, so that subsequent call to RDHOME
  will not generate the "MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK SET ID" message when
  using a virgin pack set.  /DARREN 3-18-83

/K46
----


REFSTR - Repair the home page retrieval pointer table which got broken
  back in K27/K28 - the table must match the home page exactly.
/DARREN 3-20-83

/K47
----

PICON:  Fixed typo from /K06 version - moving INTERN PGFUIO inside an
	IFNCPU(KI) conditional.
SIMKL:  Repeat 0'ed OUT the KL-simulator leaving the global symbol KL$SIM
	inside an IFCPU(KL) conditional.  If the KL-simulator is wanted,
	should be re-installed via a new config symbol, so that PARIS can
	continue to exclude it if desired.   /CARL  3-24-83

ONCE - Fix recently-introduced bug in PGY table allocation - CAVPGN is
  NOT the size of the PGY table if there are holes in core...

ONCE, SCNSER - Inserted console messages that describe what is
	happening during RELOAD.  /SUTTOND 8-31-83

/L02
----

CORE1 - modified code @ REMOV5+5 to handle context pages for frames other
	than the current frame.  This should fix the REMCHR+4 and REMCHR+11
	crashes.  /SUTTOND 8-31-83

IOCSS:	Inserted code in routine DEVPHY: to crash if the user requests
	device SYS and SYS cannot be found in the DDB chain.
	/SUTTOND 10-5-83

/L05
----

SCNSER: removed local variables THSTIM and MXTIM and made them external.
Code will now use the global THSTIM and MXTIM defined in COMMON and
appearing in NSWTAB+41 and NSWTAB+42 (gettabable) like it was supposed to.

ONCDSK: Enclosed test for disk unit off-line inside IFCPU (F3)
	conditional @ KONTOK.  /SUTTOND 10-20-83

/L07
----

ONCDSK: Set EVASIZ to zero @ FILOPT+5 so that EVMINI will get
	called the 1st time EVMALC is called when allocating memory
	for UDB's.  /SUTTOND 10-28-83

COMCON: POP registers S and P1 off the stack in case of error in
	argument to TALK command in SEND: routine.  /SUTTOND 11-1-83

/L09
----

PICON:	Deleted command to clear Cache Sweep Done Flag in routines CSUNL
	and CSVAL.  Not necessary since monitor waits every time for
	cache-sweep-done interrupt.  /SUTTOND 11-2-83

/L10
----

COMCON: Added "Special Command Mode" to run RCM program in case
	PVSCMD is set and user types otherwise illegal command.
S.MAC:  added PVSCMD==200,,0
FRMSER: Child now inherits RCM program on a CREFRM

Note: RCM program now receives monitor parsed command name in sixbit
in user AC 1.  This prevents problem caused by multiple rescan's.

FILFND: Prevented loop in DB linkages by inserting a conditional
	at SRCFINI+6.  /SUTTOND 11-16-83

Modified ONCE and COMMON so that FRECOR will default to the available
executive virtual memory below ONCE.  /SUTTOND 11-21-83

PICON:  Added code @ KEYSET+3 to crash if SCNINT is not called within
	2000 tics(17 secs).  /SUTTOND 12-13-83

/L15
----

ONCDSK: Amplified error messages in routine UNTDWN.  /SUTTOND 1-11-84

Added PVLOS - LogoutOnStop.  Added check at COMCON:STOP and CLOCK1:STOP1
to force LOGOUT if its set and job is being stopped.  Also check at command
dispatch time in COMCON and force RestrictedCommandMode if PVLOS is set.
Lastly, added code to FRMSER:PSHPRV and UUOCON:SETPRV to allow user to set,
but never clear PVLOS.  /WRS 1-20-84

/L16
----

Changed COMCON so panic logouts (like EXIT in a logged out job and
EXIT or STOP in a PV.LOS job) happen immediately rather than being
postponed until the next command input.  /WRS 1-27-84

/L17
----

Modified default open files/frame(OPNFPF) in COMMOD to be ^D10
so that there will be plenty of room for ATB's & FNB's in systems
with more than 1 Meg.  Specify smaller OPNFPF in the CONFnn file
for systems with less memory if necessary.    /SUTTOND 1-31-84

FILUUO: Modified SKIPGE to MOVE at CLRACH+6, eliminating slow
	crash since FNBALT(xx) is initialized to -1 for debug
	purposes.  /SUTTOND 2-23-84

/L20
----

COMMON: Inserted cache sweep in CRASHX routine so that memory in
	the crash file looks the same as it did to the CPU at the
	time of the crash.  /SUTTOND 2-29-84

/L21
----

SCNSER: Entered test for beyond last legal priority bit in LDBOUT(U)
	in routine SCOTTY at  GOLIN+2.  Don't do output on line if test
	fails.  /SUTTOND 3-2-84

/L22
----

CLOCK1: Modified inactivity timer code @INACT2+2 to use one less
        instruction, and eliminate use of T2.  Also changed comments
        for better understanding of the routine.  /CARL 4-20-84

/L23
----

ONCE:   Change CONSOLE command to set CTY flag, Added NETWORK command
        to clear CTY flag.  Use GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring
        up the system.

CTYSIM: Allow lower-case on all commands, added ctrl-z ? to print a
        short help text of legal ones.  /CARL 4-23-84

/L24
----

PICON: changed EVICT UUO to set PV.LOS (logout on stop) so an evicted job
that gets sick and halts or doesn't know any better and exits will get
logged out.    /WRS 5-22-84

/L25
----

SCHED1: changed default setting for MAPQUE (JBTWRS) feature to off.
	/WRS 6-6-84

PICON:	Removed edit /L14, code at KEYSET+3 which caused a crash if
	routine SCNINT was not called within so many (2000) tics.
	We don't need to MAKE the system "crash" here!  /CARL 6-7-84

ONCDSK: Modified CMDSCN routine, near CMDSC5 to disregard verification
	if CMDMSG is non-zero, and added new bit for MKTBL macro AB.CVR
	to ignore verify bit (AB.VER) if CTYDO flag is set (for CONSOLE).

ONCE:	Defined AB.CVR for ONCE/ONCDSK command table bits, set the bit
	for MANUAL and READONLY.  Modified CONSOLE and NETWORK commands
	to give an acceptance response and a reminder to type one of the
	system startup commands: GO, FULL, MANUAL, READONLY.

	Modified SUTTOND's amplified INITIA message to only print when
	INITIA is really being forced, i.e. TLNN (STAUTO),STATES
	/CARL 6-7-84

	Fixed TYPO which broke abbreviation of CONSOLE command by
	mispelling NETWORK as <CONSOLE>.  Also changed code at CHGSYS
	to allow larger than 255 as host number on micro-node bases.
	KI/KL's still have 255 maximum.  /CARL 6-8-84

S.MAC:	Changed SIZONC from 4 to 5 in MAPONC call for KS.  /CARL 6-13-84

ACTSER: Copy UPTLOG for new frame into supervisor info when writing the
	accounting record for .FOCFM (we are assuming that the LOGIN UUO
	handles this correctly elsewhere).  /OSMAN 7-6-84

/L31
----

F3TSER: Fixed radix in formula which calculates byte pointer into EPT page map
	to ^D18 and ^O1000 to avoid confusion.  The assembler defaults to ^D
	in the offset part of the pointer, so the calclation was always wrong.
        /CARL 7-8-84

Mis-release by Dave Sutton caused confusion.  So, to avoid further
confusion as to which /M this is, it has been decided to skip the
release of P034/M altogether and proceed to the next release.
