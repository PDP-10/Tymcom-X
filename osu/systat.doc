1    DESCRIPTION     


SYSTAT is a versatile Tymshare utility program on the TYMCOM-X system.
It displays at a terminal extensive and detailed information about
activity on the TYMCOM-X system at any time.

This document supersedes all other Tymshare documentation of SYSTAT and
all DEC documentation of SYSTAT which has been used by Tymshare.




2    GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS      



2.1    Calling the program         

SYSTAT is called from the Monitor or Executive mode with a command in
the following general form:

-SYSTAT [search command] [job status control command(s)]
        [system information control command(s)]

where the bracketed portions are any of those commands listed in Section
3.  Any SYSTAT command can be abbreviated to the shortest form which
distinguishes it from any other SYSTAT command.  In this manual, a
carriage return completes a command unless stated otherwise.

SYSTAT will, in general, print a preamble followed by a summary of
activity and then return to the executive.  The various commands given
to SYSTAT when calling it as well as the license of the user determine
the type and quantity of information which is printed.  The SYSTAT
program leaves the terminal in the Executive or Monitor mode throughout
the operation of the program.  The activity summary is a combination of
the optional reports that can be obtained from SYSTAT.  These are a job
status display and numerous other system information displays that are
selected by the user.



2.2    System commands which access SYSTAT           

The following commands to the Monitor also access SYSTAT:
        PSP
        SYSNO
        USERS
        WHERE [names (user or device)]
        WHO

These commands are explained in Section 3.6.

3    VALID COMMANDS      



3.1    Search commands        

The following commands (options) select the jobs about which information
will be printed.  Normally, all jobs which the user is authorized to see
will be listed.  Using a search command causes a job status display to
be done (without headings) subject to the options selected.

                        account number and universal user
                        number.  Either the GAN or the UUN may
                        be replaced by an asterisk designating a
                        wild half; for example: [6], [7,*],
                        [*,122], [1,21].

3.6.3    USERS         

This command prints information about any users on the system in the
following format:

Users=A Det=B [C,D], Queues: RUN=E DIO=F, TIO=G IO=H SPC=I

where:  A = number of jobs logged into the system
        B = number of jobs logged in that are detached
        C = number of jobs logged in with user's global account
        D = number of jobs logged in under your user name
        E = jobs running (monitor states:  RN WS TS DS)
        F = jobs doing disk I/O (MQ DA CB DI MO)
        G = jobs doing TTY I/O or idle (TI ^C)
        H = jobs doing non-disk/TTY I/O (DT DC MT IO)
        I = jobs in special queues (SL AX)



3.6.4    WHERE         

This command prints information about a specified device or user name.
If a user name is given, SYSTAT verifies if the user is logged in and
prints the job number; if a TTY, SYSTAT names the job which is attached
to the TTY.

Arguments to the WHERE command are separated by commas and may be any of
the following:

        device name:
        user name
        TTYnn:          (where nn is a number)
        OPR:

Information is reported in corresponding order to the arguments.  If the
user forgets to use arguments or leaves a trailing comma, SYSTAT will
prompt for the information by typing "ENTER NAME:  ".


3.6.5    WHO         

This command lists all users on the system about whom the user is
authorized to obtain information.  Arguments to the command are:

nnn             Given job number.
nnn-nnn         Any range of job numbers.
.               List the user's name and number.
*               Same as "."

The default case is to list all users.

3.7    Obtaining HELP information         

SYSTAT and the Monitor level calls which access SYSTAT accept the
command "?" which gives a brief set of instructions and indicates how
more information may be obtained.  To get a copy of all HELP
documentation available, use the command "?HELP".

4.3.1    DISK command          

This switch permits users with SYSTAT license to obtain a summary of the
system's file structures.  Printed out are the names of each pack (both
logical and pack identification), the number of blocks free on each
pack, the number of reads and writes performed on that pack, and the
errors (if any) which the Monitor has detected on that pack.  The
following table describes the various errors that can be reported and
their corresponding abbreviations:

The following unit types are recognized:

        FH - (1) RC10 Controller with RD10 or RM10B drum
        DP - (2) RP10 Controller with RP01, RP02 or RP03 disk pack
        BP - (4) SA10 Controller with 3330 disk pack

SYSTAT will output a series of short messages followed by numbers
(except as noted below).  These messages are as follows:

HDEV            Number of Hard Device errors
HDAT            Number of Hard Data errors
HCONI           CONI status returned from the last Hard error
HDATAI          DATAI status returned from the last Hard error

HLBN            Last logical block number of the last Hard error
SDEV            Number of Soft Device errors
SDAT            Number of Soft Data errors
SCONI           CONI status returned fron the last Soft error
SDATAI          DATAI status returned fron the last Soft error
SLBN            Last logical block number of the last Soft error
RET             Number of retries on last error
SATFAIL         Number of SAT failures (software)
RIBERR          Number of RIB errors (software)
CKSERR          Number of Checksum errors (software)
THUNG           Number of times unit hung in transfer
HUNG            Number of times unit hung (other than THUNG)

When a hard or soft CONI error is reported, SYSTAT will output a "(" and
then print a series of self-explanatory messages which "decipher" the
CONI.

When a hard or soft LBN (logical block # of last error) is reported,
SYSTAT will output a "(" and then print a series of messages which
"decipher" the LBN.  The messages which are not self-explanatory are
detailed below.

        FH
TRACK:#        Track last error occurred on
SECTOR:#       Sector last error occurred on

The summary of information printed by the FILES command is divided into
five fields.  The following is an explanation of the four possible modes
which could appear in the MODE field.

Mode            Explanation

DUMP            The file is opened without any Input/Output
                buffers.
IN              File is opened with just an input buffer.
OUT             File is opened with just an output buffer.
UPD             File is opened with both input and
                output buffers (UPDATE mode).

SYSTAT license is required to obtain some of the system information such
as complete disk status reports and to get a job status report on jobs
outside one's own GAN.  Performance statistics that are reported will
not reflect the total system load if the user has inadequate license to
obtain the necessary information.

Read files license is necessary to obtain all the file information (such
as shared directories).
