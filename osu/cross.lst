   113					COMMENT * THIS IS AN EXPLANATION OF THE CREF SYMBOL TABLE
   114					AND LINE NUMBER STORAGE MECANISM. LINE NUMBERS ARE STORED IN
   115					TWO WORD BLOCKS. THE FIRST WORD OF EACH BLOCK IS GUARANTEED
   116					TO HAVE AN EVEN ADDRESS. THE FIRST WORD OF THE BLOCK AND
   117					THE LEFT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD ARE USED TO STORE LINE NUMBERS.
   118					THE RIGHT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD IS A POINTER TO THE NEXT
   119					TWO WORD BLOCK. THE POINTER IS 0 IF THIS IS THE LAST
   120					BLOCK. (THIS IS TRUE OF ALL THINGS REFERED TO AS POINTERS
   121					IN THE FUTURE) LINE NUMBERS ARE STORED IN SIXBIT BYTES.
   122					CREF PICKS UP THE FIRST SIX BIT BYTE. IF THE HIGH ORDER
   123					BIT OF THESE SIX IS 0, THEN CREF HAS ALL OF THE LINE NUMBER.
   124					IF IT IS NON-ZERO, CREF SHIFTS IT LEFT 5 AND ORS IN THE LOW ORDER
   125					FIVE BITS OF THE NEXT SIX BIT BYTE, REPEATING
   126					THIS PROCESS UNTIL IT FINDS A BYTE WITH THE HIGH ORDER BIT 0.
   127					THE LINE NUMBERS THAT ARE STORED ARE RELITIVE. THAT IS THE
   128					NUMBER CALCULATED AS ABOVE IS ADDED TO THE AS LINE NUMBER
   129					TO OBTAIN THE ACTUAL LINE NUMBER. WHEN THE BYTES HAVE
   130					BEEN PICKED UP TO FORM A NUMBER, THE LOW ORDER BIT IS ON
   131					IF A DEFINITION OF THIS SYMBOL OCCURED ON THIS LINE. THE NUMBER
   132					IS THEN SHIFTED RIGHT ONE BEFORE BEING ADDED TO THE
   133					LINE NUMBER ON WHICH THE LAST OCCURANCE OF THIS SYMBOL WAS FOUND.
   134					EXAMPLE:  IF SYMBOL FOO OCCURS ON (OCTAL) LINE NUMBER 100,
   135					107(DEFINITION) 132 AND 167(DEFINITION), THE BYTES LOOK LIKE
   136					44,0,17,41,6,41,33. THE FIRST BYTE HAS
   137					THE 40 BIT ON INDICATING IT SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH THE
   138					SECOND BYTE. THESE TWO BYTES COMBINED GIVE THE NUMBER 200. THE
   139					LOW ORDER BIT IS OFF INDICATING IT IS NOT A DEFINITION. THE
   140					REMAINING BITS INDICATE IT OCCURED 100(OCTAL) LINES AFTER
   141					THE LAST OCCURANCE(0) OR LINE 100. THE NEXT BYTE HAS BIT 40 OFF
   142					SO THATS ALL THERE IS. THE LOW ORDER BIT IS ON SO IT
   143					IS A DEFINITION. THE REMAINING BITS GIVE THE NUMBER 7 SO
   144					THE OCCURANCE IS 7 LINES PASED THE LAST ONE(100) OR 107 ETC.
   145
   146						EACH CHAIN OF SIX BIT BYTES HAS A HEADER CALLED
   147					A "LINE HEADER". THIS IS A TWO WORD BLOCK. THE
   148					FIRST WORD IS A BYTE POINTER INDICATING WHERE TO PLACE THE
   149					NEXT SIX BIT BYTE. THE RIGHT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD POINTS
   150					TO THE FIRST 2 WORD BLOCK OF SIX BIT BYTES. BIT 5 OF
   151					THE SECOND WORD IS ON IF A NON-DEFINING OCCURANCE
   152					WAS ON THE LAST LINE NUMBER, BIT 4 IS ON IF A DEFINING OCCURANCE
   153					AND BOTH ON IF BOTH(THIS IS SO CREF DOES NOT PRINT THE
   154					SAME LINE NUMBER TWICE EVEN THOUGH THE SYMBOL OCCURED TWICE
   155					ON THAT LINE. IT IS WILLING TO PRINT THE NUMBER TWICE, ONCE
   156					AS A NON-DEFINITION AND ONCE AS A DEFINITION)
   157					BIT 3 IS ON IF THE DEFINING OCCURRENCE IN THIS CHAIN IS AN
   158					EXTERNAL STATEMENT.
   159

   161						THERE ARE THREE SYMBOL TABLES KEPT BY CREF. ONE IS FOR
   162					OPCODES, THE SECOND FOR MACROS (AND OPDEFS) THE OTHER FOR
   163					OTHER SYMBOLS. EACH SYMBOL TABLE HAS A BLOCK WHICH
   164					IS HASH WORDS LONG. A SYMBOL IS DEVIDED BY HASH AND THE
   165					REMAINDER TAKEN. THIS ENTRY OF THE BLOCK IS A LINKED LIST
   166					OF SYMBOLS WITH THIS "HASH CODE". EACH SYMBOL ENTRY TAKES
   167					FOUR WORDS. THE FIRST WORD IS THE SIXBIT FOR THE NAME OF THE
   168					SYMBOL. THE RIGHT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD IS A POINTER TO
   169					THE NEXT SYMBOL WITH THIS "HASH CODE". THE LEFT HALF OF THE
   170					SECOND WORD IS 0. BIT 0 OF THE THIRD WORD MEANS TO IGNORE
   171					THIS SYMBOL(I'M SURE THIS MEANS SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW
   172					JUST WHAT). BITS 1-17 OF THE THIRD WORD ARE THE LINE NUMBER ON
   173					WHICH THE SYMBOL WAS LAST SEEN AND ARE USED TO COMPUTE RELITIVE
   174					LINE NUMBERS TO BE STORED AS ABOVE. THE RIGHT HALF OF THE
   175					THIRD WORD IS A POINTER TO THE "LINE HEADER" FOR THIS SYMBOL.
   176						THE FOURTH WORD OF THE SYMBOL TABLE ENTRY TAKES
   177					A LITTLE EXPLANATION. THIS WORD IS USED ONLY FOR BLOCK STRUCTURE
   178					PROCESSORS. A BLOCK STRUCTURE PROCESSOR MAY HAVE
   179					SEVERAL SYMBOLS WITH THE SAME NAME BUT OCCURING IN DIFFERENT
   180					BLOCKS. THUS A BLOCK STRUCTURE PROCESSOR USUALLY EMITS A
   181					UNIQUE NUMBER TO INDICATE THE SYMBOL INSTEAD OF THE SYMBOL ITSELF.
   182					THE SYMBOL NUMBER AND NAME/BLOCK ARE THEN LATER EQUATED. THE
   183					PROCESSOR MAY AT SOME TIME FIND THAT TWO SYMBOLS WHICH IT
   184					THOUGHT WERE DIFFERENT ARE REALLY THE SAME. THIS REQUIRES
   185					THAT THE LISTS OF LINE NUMBERS BE COMBINED. IT IS ASSUMED
   186					THAT ALL THE LINE NUMBERS IN ONE LIST COME BEFORE ALL THE
   187					LINE NUMBERS IN THE OTHER LIST. (THIS IS ALWAYS TRUE IN PRACTICE)
   188					THE FOURTH WORD OF THE SYMBOL TABLE IS USED TO HOLD POINTERS
   189					TO THE "LINE HEADERS" FOR THE LISTS OF LINE NUMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN
   190					COMBINED IN THIS WAY. THE POINTER IN THE THIRD WORD IS ALWAYS
   191					TO THE LIST WITH THE LARGEST LINE NUMBERS. EACH SEPERATE
   192					LIST STARTS WITH RELITIVE LINE NUMBER 0. THE LEFT HALF
   193					OF THE FOURTH WORD POINTES TO A TWO WORD BLOCK WHOSE
   194					FIRST WORD HAS A POINTER TO A "LINE HEADER" IN ITS RIGHT HALF
   195					AND A POINTER TO A SIMILAR TWO WORD BLOCK IN ITS LEFT HALF.
   196					THE SECOND WORD IS UNUSED. THE FIRST "LINE HEADER" HAS THE
   197					SMALLEST LINE NUMBERS, THE SECOND THE NEXT SMALLEST, ETC.
   198					THE RIGHT HALF OF THE FOURTH WORD POINTS TO THE LAST OF THESE
   199					TWO WORD BLOCKS TO MAKE ADDING MORE THE THE LIST EASIER.
   200					WHEN THE DEFINITION OF THE SYMBOL/BLOCK NAME IS FINALLY SEEN
   201					THE RIGHT HALF OF THE FOURTH WORD IS CHANGED TO A POINTER TO
   202					THE BLOCK END ENTRY FRO THAT BLOCK(SEE BELOW). IT IS ASSUMED
   203					THAT NO MORE ADDITIONS TO THE LINE NUMBER LIST FOR A GIVEN
   204					SYMBOL WILL BE MADE AFTER ITS NAME IS DEFINED. 
   205						IN A MACRO PROGRAM, THE SYMBOL USED IS THE REAL SYMBOL
   206					INSTEAD OF A NUMBER REPRESENTING IT. THUS COMBINATION AND
   207					DEFINITION NEVER HAPPEN AND THE FOURTH WORD IS NOT USED.
   208

   210						THE REMAINING PIECE OF LIST STRUCTURE IS THE BLOCK TABLE
   211					WHICH OCCURS ONLY FOR BLOCK STRUCTURE PROCESSORS. THE VARIABLE
   212					BLKST HAS A POINTER TO THE BLOCK TABLE. EACH ENTRY HAS
   213					FOUR WORDS. THE FIRST WORD IS THE SIXBIT FOR THE BLOCK NAME.
   214					THE RIGHT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD IS A POINTER TO THE NEXT ENTRY.
   215					THE LEFT HALF OF THE SECOND WORD IS A LEVEL NUMBER.
   216					THIS IS JUST THE DEPTH OF THIS BLOCK IN THE BLOCK STRUCTURE.
   217					THE OUTER MOST BLOCK IS LEVEL 0, NEXT INNER LEVEL 1 ETC.
   218					THE RIGHT HALF OF THE THIRD WORD IS THE LINE NUMBER ON WHICH
   219					THE START OR END OF THE BLOCK OCCURED. THIS BLOCK TABLE HAS
   220					ONE ENTRY FOR THE START OF EACH BLOCK AND ONE FOR THE END OF
   221					EACH BLOCK. THE ENTRIES ARE IN THE ORDER IN WHICH BEGINING
   222					OF BLOCK AND END OF BLOCK ARE SEEN BY THE PROCESSOR. THE
   223					LEFT HALF OF THE THIRD WORD IS A 0 IF THIS IS A START OF A BLOCK
   224					AND 1 IF THIS IS THE END OF A BLOCK. THE FOURTH WORD IS NOT
   225					USED.
   226						NOTE THAT BLOCKS ARE ALWAYS A MULTIPLE OF TWO WORDS LONG.
   227					THIS IS DONE SO THAT THE SIX BIT BYTES FOR THE LINE
   228					NUMBERS ALWAYS START WITH AN EVEN WORD *
