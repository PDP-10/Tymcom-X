     1.0  OVERVIEW

     ASP (Absolute Structure save and  restore  Program)  is  a  utility
     which  allows  an entire file structure to be saved to and restored
     from magnetic tape.  Whereas file to tape save and restore programs
     like  TITO  save each file individually, ASP saves all the pages on
     the structure sequentially.  Therefore, it is not possible to  save
     or restore individual files with ASP.

     The usefulness of ASP lies in the fact that it is  much  faster  to
     save  a  file  structure page by page than to save it file by file.
     TITO takes from 1 to 2 hours per reel of  tape,  depending  on  the
     size  of  the  files that are being saved.  ASP takes 11 minutes to
     write one reel of tape at 6250 BPI, regardless of the state of  the
     file structure.

     Since ASP runs as the only job on the system (if it  did  not,  the
     file  structure  would  not  be in a stable state to have its image
     saved) there is no synchronization problem between  files  -  since
     there are no other jobs, all files are saved in a stable state.

     The format of an ASP tape has been designed to minimize both  human
     and  machine  error  in  the save/restore.  Each tape has the exact
     date and time it was written, so that it is impossible  to  try  to
     restore  tapes  from  different  saves  to  a structure.  Each data
     record is followed by a small epilogue record containing a checking
     code and record serial number with respect to all tapes in the set.
     This allows recovery from tape errors (although at the  expense  of
     losing data).



     2.0  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

     Whenever ASP is run for saving or restoring a file structure, there
     can  be  no other jobs logged into the system, including CHKPNT and
     PJ.  The system must be super-shut (sched 600000) to ensure that no
     other users can login.

     For SAVEs, the save to tape can be done, and the system can then be
     restored  to normal timesharing state by running CHKPNT by hand and
     unshutting the system.  Thus, the monitor need not be taken down to
     do the save.

     For RESTOREs, a file structure must be setup to  restore  to  which
     has  the  same structure name, capacity, number of units, and first
     four characters of unit ID.  The system must be brought up in "READ
     ONLY"  mode.  The RESTORE is then performed.  Immediately after the
     restore, the system must be taken down, as the SAT  tables  on  the
     disk  have been re-written and the checking counts that the monitor
     keeps in core will no longer match those of the SAT tables  on  the
                                                                  Page 2


     disk.   The  system  is then brought up again, and DSKCLN should be
     run to ensure the integrity of the file structure.



     3.0  COMMANDS

     Commands may be abbrieviated to their shortest unique form.  If  no
     tape  unit  is  specified  for  a  command  which requires one, the
     currently open tape unit is assumed, if there is one.



     3.1  SAVE <tape Unit>

     This command is used to save a file structures contents on  one  or
     more ASP tapes.  The system must be super-shut, and the job running
     ASP must be the only one on the system in order  for  the  SAVE  to
     proceded.   This  ensures  the file system is internally consistent
     during the entire save operation.

     ASP will print out the information it writes to the header  of  the
     tape, and begin the restore using the current density.



     3.1.1  End Of Tape - If the end of the current tape is reached, ASP
     will print "NEXT TAPE UNIT:".  The operator should then type in the
     name of the tape unit on which the next tape to be written  is  on.
     If  the  current  tape unit is to be used, the operator must rewind
     the tape at the tape unit's console and  mount  the  new  tape.   A
     carriage  return  will  be interpreted by ASP to mean the currently
     open tape unit.



     3.1.2  Unrecoverable Write Errors - If an unrecoverable write error
     to  tape occurs, ASP will print out an error message and prompt the
     operator with "NEXT TAPE UNIT:".  The operator  should  then  mount
     another  tape  on  the  tape unit and type in the tape unit's name.
     ASP will then rewrite the tape it was currently working on.



     3.2  CHECK <tape Unit>

     This command reads in what should be the ASP header record  of  the
     specified  tape.   It  prints  out the ASP version number, date and
     time  the  tape  set  was  written,  structure  name,  first   four
     characters  of  unit  ID  of  the  units in the structure, and tape
     number.  This command is used to identify ASP tapes in the event of
     the physical tape labels being unreadable or non-existent.
                                                                  Page 3


     3.3  RESTOR <tape Unit>

     This command restores a set of ASP tapes to the file structure.



     3.3.1  Requirements To Commence RESTOR - The file structure  to  be
     restored  to  must  have  the  same  capacity, number of units, and
     structure name as the structure that was originally saved onto  the
     ASP  tapes to be restored.  The file structure should be refreshed.
     The system should then be brought up in "READONLY" mode.  (If  this
     is  not done, the system will crash during the restore.) The system
     should then be super-shut, and the ASP job should be the  only  one
     on  the  system.   The  ASP  tapes  to  be  restored must have been
     recorded together with one ASP SAVE command.  (The header  of  each
     tape  contains  the  exact  date and time the SAVE was started, and
     these must match.)



     3.3.2  End Of Tape - When the  end  of  the  tape  currently  being
     restored  is  reached, ASP will prompt with "NEXT TAPE UNIT:".  The
     operator should mount the next tape number  in  sequence  with  the
     last  restored on a tape unit and type the name of the tape unit to
     ASP.



     3.3.3  Restore Completion - If the restore goes correctly, ASP will
     print  a  message  informing  the  operator  that  the  restore has
     completed successfully.



     3.3.4  Post Restore Procedure - After an ASP restore is  completed,
     the  system  should  be  taken  down  immediately with a deposit in
     location 30.  This is because the SAT pages on the  file  structure
     have  been  overwritten  on  the  disk,  and  the bit counts in the
     monitor under which ASP ran no longer match those  new  SAT  pages.
     Thus,  it  is possible to see the message "BAD SAT ON <disk unit>".
     Ignore these messages after an ASP restore if they are seen.



     3.3.5  Aborted Restores - If for any reason an ASP restore does not
     complete  successfully,  the  structure  being  restored to must be
     refreshed and the restore started over from the beginning.  If this
     is not done, the file structure is very probably in an inconsistent
     state.

     3.3.6  Run DSKCLN After A RESTOR - As a precaution,  DSKCLN  should
     be run over the freshly restored structure to ensure file structure
     integerity and consistency.



     3.4  HELP

     Prints out a list of commands and a short description of them.



     3.5  STATUS <tape Unit>

     Prints out specified tape unit name, available  densities,  current
     density, and whether or not the tape is write protected and at load
     point.



     3.6  DENSIT <density>

     If no  density  is  specified,  DENSIT  will  just  print  out  the
     available  densities on the specified tape unit.  Else, it will set
     the recording density for the entire run to the specified argument.
     (Example:  DENSIT 6250).



     3.7  REWIND <tape Unit>

     Rewinds the specified tape unit.



     3.8  UNLOAD <tape Unit>

     Unloads the specified tape unit.



     3.9  OPEN <tape Unit>

     Sets the currently open tape unit to the specified argument if  the
     unit is available.



     3.10  DAYTIM

     Prints out current date and time.
                                                                  Page 5


     3.11  QUIT

     Exits from ASP.



     4.0  KNOWN DEFICIENCIES

     On restores, ASP attempts no recovery from unrecoverable tape  read
     errors.   The  restore  is aborted.  Future versions of ASP will be
     able to continue past the bad record or  records  to  complete  the
     restore,  at  the expense of losing some data.  DSKCLN will be able
     to handle the problem of losing RIBs or UFD data pages,  but  there
     will  be no way to detect the lossage of data pages from user files
     unless DSKCLN is modified to input a  list  of  disk  page  numbers
     which have been lost.
