Significant changes to TYMCOM-X between P034/N and P034/P      12-Sep-85

Major reliability improvements:

  1)  Fixed the INPUT RING PROCESSING TIMEOUT crash problem caused by an
      improperly setup user page map.

  2)  Stopcode information is output to the CTY when the system crashes,
      instead of just the enigmatic BOOTS LOADED message.  The new messages
      contain more information than is reported by CRSHID.  For more details
      on the stopcode mechanism, see the accompanying document STOPCD.MEM.

  3)  Fixed the problem with running out of FRECOR and restricted the size
      of FRECOR allocated on smaller processors to allow more memory for
      user jobs.

New features:

  1)  The frame inactivity timeout feature is now fully implemented.  The
      timeout may be set and read both by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT n" monitor
      command and the SETINA, SETPRV and GETTAB UUOs.  In addition, this
      feature can be enabled automatically by setting the appropriate bit
      in the LUD.  A system-wide default may be set by the operator or
      system administrator using the command "SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY n".

  2)  The TRU limit for a job may now be set or extended by both the monitor
      command "SET LIMIT n" and the SETLIM UUO.  A frame my now request an
      interrupt when the TRU limit has been exceeded.

  3)  New GETTAB tables have been added.  These tables will be fully
      documented in the next release of the YAMM.

  4)  Some errors which caused the system to be reloaded are now continuable
      stopcodes.  Instead of causing "BOOTS LOADED", these errors now output
      a message to the CTY describing the problem.  If the error affects only
      one job, then that job is halted, but the system as a whole continues
      running.
