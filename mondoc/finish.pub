FINISH
.description
Any files which have not been closed are
closed, and pending data is written from the buffers.
All devices are deassigned.

Useful after aborting a program with two ^Cs to close
files that may be partially written.
If this is not done,
the next RESET operation will cause the file to be closed
in a maner that will save the previous version, if any.
