Continue a halted process in a frame.
.syntax
CONTINUE
CCONTINUE
.description
A process which was interrupted by the HALT command or by a continuable
error may be resumed at exactly the point it was suspended by use of
this command.
The CCONTINUE form leaves the terminal in monitor mode, although the
process is still running,
usually so the terminal may be detached.

If the JERR bit is set in the frame status word,
the frame is not continuable and these commands will result in

	?can't continue
