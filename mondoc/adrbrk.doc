   SYNOPSIS

           Setup an address break condition for a KL-10.

   SYNTAX

           ADRBRK
           ADRBRK address args

   DESCRIPTION

           Manipulate  the  hardware  address  break  feature  of  the KL-10
           processor.   The  address  break  is  only  effective  while  the
           requesting frame is  running thereby allowing multiple  frames to
           effectively have address breaks specified at the same time.

           In  the form  with  no address  or  args, the  current  status is
           reported.

           Setting a new address break clears any previous address breaks in
           effect.  When a memory reference of one of the types specified in
           the args is made to the location specified by address,  the frame
           is  stopped  and a  message  is printed  indicating  the  type of
           reference made.

           READ      Break on any read which is not an instruction fetch.
           WRITE     Break on any write operation.
           FETCH     Break on an instruction fetch.
           ALL       Break on any reference.
           NONE      Clear the address break.
           MONITOR   Indicates address is in the monitor's virtual memory.
                     This requires Write Core license.
           <null>    If no args are specified, ALL is assumed.

   CAVEATS

           Only  available  on KL-10  processors.   Setting  monitor address
           breaks is very dangerous.
