                           TYMCOM-X ON THE F3


    Most procedures for backup are the same as for Tymcom-X on a KI
    or KL.  Most of the standard utilities for Tymcom-X perform as
    expected.

    The restart procedures are different, and involve setting and
    toggling hardware switches on the machine itself.  (See pages
    2-4)

    The base for an F3 is a micronode PDP 11/03, similar to the set
    up for a 2020.  However the F3 will not currently resynch with
    its base, and therefore if the base crashes, is reloaded, or in
    some other way drops the connection, the F3 must be reloaded
    with a warm restart.  In the event that new code is to be loaded
    into the base, the F3 should be brought down gracefully using
    TAKEIT, and then be brought up again after the reload.

                      F3 Bootstrap Procedures




    1.0  HOW TO BOOT IF MONITOR WAS RUNNING

         1.  Set all switches to down position except for MI and
             MEM PAR STOP.

         2.  Switch CONSOLE STOP up and then down.   This  stops
             the machine.

         3.  Press the momentary CONSOLE RESET up.  This  resets
             the  machine.   The PROG HALT light should be on at
             this point.

         4.  Set the address switches to 147 octal.

         5.  Press CONSOLE START up.  This should  initiate  the
             bootstrap  procedure.   The message "BOOTS:" should
             appear on the console, and eventually
             "LOADING (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV"  should appear.  The system 
             should come up within 5-15 minutes.



    If the system does not successfully  boot  using  the  above
    procedure,  use  the  procedure for loading the monitor from
    tape.  (See also notes on page 5)



    2.0  LOADING THE MONITOR FROM TAPE

         1.  Mount the current monitor  bootstrap  tape  (marked
             USE  ME)  on  the  tape  drive,  set the density to
             1600BPI.

         2.  Make sure all switches are in  the  down  position,
             including MI and MEM PAR STOP.

         3.  Set 5000 octal in the Address Switches.

         4.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR STOP switch up.

         5.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PC FROM SW switch up.

         6.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CLR switch up.

         7.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
                                                          Page 3


         8.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI  PC  FROM  SW  and  STOP
             switches back down.

         9.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PARITY STOP switch up.

        10.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
             This  should  start  the tape reading in.  If it is
             successful, all the lights  under  DATA  should  be
             off.  The tape takes about 5-10 seconds to read in.

        11.  When the tape stops reading in, clear  the  address
             switches and set 140 octal in them.

        12.  Press the momentary CONSOLE START switch up.

        13.  Press the momentary CONSOLE RESET switch up.

        14.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MEM PARITY STOP switch up.

        15.  Press  the  momentary  CONSOLE  START  switch   up.
             Output  should  now  appear on the console terminal
             which includes  the  phrase  MONITOR  JUST  LOADED.
             After about 5-15 minutes, the system should be back
             on the air.  If the monitor asks for  DSKCLN  type,
             type  in  "FULL"  unless  you know that it is OK to
             give another answer.




    3.0  MICROCODE LOAD PROCEDURE

         1.  Mount current Microcode tape on tape drive (the one
             marked "use me")

         2.  Set  density  switch  to   density   indicated   on
             Microcode tape label.

         3.  Make sure all switches are in  the  down  position,
             including MICRO PROCESSOR MI and MEM PAR STOP.

         4.  Set 10 Octal in the Address switches

         5.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR STOP switch up.

         6.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PC FROM SW switch up.

         7.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CLR switch up.

         8.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.

         9.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI  PC  FROM  SW  and  STOP
             switches back down.

        10.  Press the momentary MICRO PROCESSOR CONT switch up.
             This  should  start  the tape reading in.  If it is
             successful, all the lights  under  DATA  should  be
             off.  The tape takes about a second to read in.

        11.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MI PARITY STOP switch up.

        12.  Remove  the microcode  tape and  mount the  current
             monitor tape.

        13.  Press the  CONSOLE CONTINUE switch up.  This should
             start  the tape  reading in.  The tape takes  about
             5 - 10 seconds to read in.

        14.  When the tape stops reading in, clear  the  address
             switches and set 140 octal in them.

        15.  Press the momentary CONSOLE START switch up.

        16.  Set the MICRO PROCESSOR MEM PARITY STOP and MICRO
             PROCESSOR MI PARITY STOP switches up.

        17.  Press  the  momentary  CONSOLE  START  switch   up.
             Output  should  now  appear on the console terminal
             which includes  the  phrase  MONITOR  JUST  LOADED.
             After about 5-15 minutes, the system should be back
             on the air.  If the monitor asks for  DSKCLN  type,
             type  in  "FULL"  unless  you know that it is OK to
             give another answer.



    4.0  POWER UP PROCEDURE FOR F3

         1.  Turn off main power to disks.  Switches are located
             in  the  back  of the CDC disk units, on lower left
             hand side.

         2.  Turn off power to the F3  processor.   The  correct
             power  switch  is  the silver colored toggle switch
             located on the power supply panel of  the  F3,  and
             not the black circuit breaker which is located near
             the bottom of the machine.

         3.  Power the F3 back up using the silver toggle switch

         4.  Power  up  the  disks  one  at  a  time.   This  is
             necessary  because all three disks being powered up
             at once will cause an overload and trip the circuit
             breaker.   After  powering  up a disk, wait for its
             ready light to go on before powering  up  the  next
             one.

         5.  Load  Microcode  and  Monitor  (see  Microcode  and
             Monitor load procedures)
                                                              Page 5

    Notes on reloading:


    1.  Sometimes the F3 takes several tries to find SYSTEM.SAV.
        Therefore it is worthwhile if BOOTS comes back with an error
        such as:

        READ ERROR OR EOF

        or

        NO FILE

        and return to 

        BOOTS:

        to try just a carriage return a few times.

    2.  The F3 cannot presently resynch with its base.  If the base
        should crash, or somehow stop "talking" to the F3, the F3
        should be recycled.  This is normally accomplished with a
        147 restart.  (See page 2)

    3.  If the F3 does not get the date and time from the network 
        within the software time limit set, a message will appear on
        the console after the initialization complete message:

            Initialization completed
        ? Date and time not set

        An operator should log in, set the date and time in the
        formats given, and "unshut" the system by setting the
        schedule to 0.  This is done by setting OP license, and then
        giving the command

        SCH 0

    4.  If you want to do anything different in bringing up an F3
        that would require you to talk to ONCE, you must set sense
        switch 4 before bringing up the machine.  This is
        accomplished by manually setting the switch on the front of
        the machine.

    5.  In the event of a power failure, the base must be loaded
        first, then the F3 brought up from tape starting with
        microcode.

NODE 421 LOADING:

    421 is the base for 897 (Bldg A, Bubb Road Foonly)

    If you notice the node is down or halted, first check the
    console for 421 to find out which condition it is in.  If it is
    halted, it may be proceeded, or restarted without reloading (all
    commands are upper case only):

    @P                                             ; "P" for proceed
            or
    @1000G                                         ; "G" for go

    If this does not work, then something must be wrong with the
    current image of the node in memory, and it must be reloaded.

    ------------

    421 can only be reloaded from the network.  Hit the RESTART
    button on 421.  The HALT switch should be up.  (Run light should
    be on after RESTART button is toggled; two lights should be on.)

    NOTE:  only a few usernames are authorized by LOADII to load
    421.  NETWORK CONTROL (117-5195) can reload.  You will have to
    give them all the pertinent information as they get rather
    confused by micronodes.

    Login to :57 or :39  (this cannot be an aux circuit!)

    Set license

    .GF CURR11              ;Current file may be NEW11
    .R LOADII               ;This will only work for authorized users
    
    NODE LOADER VERSION- 2.11
    ENTER FUNCTION:L
    ENTER NEIGHBOR NODE:2767
    ENTER KERNEL HOST ON NODE 2243: 2439
    ENTER LINE NUMBER:15
    ENTER OBJECT FILE NAME:ND421.BND
    <program begins loading sequence>
    .

    It is normal to have a great many lost packets reported by
    LOADII.

    If you get a message that the system is unavailable, and will
    retry in 30 seconds, just be patient; however, if you get SYSTEM
    UNAVAILABLE LOGIN ERROR, RESPONSE:000000000004 someone at TYMNET
    has probably shut down all access and pass throughs to node
    2767,and you will have to wait until it is back up and
    available.

    ------------

    Order to follow when there is a power hit:

    1.  Reload 421 from 39 or 57

    2.  Reload 897 with full DSKCLN (set sense switch 4 before
        loading monitor, command FULL to ONCE)
