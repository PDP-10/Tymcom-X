Changes to the TYMCOM-X operating system between P034/K and P034/L   Page 1


I.  Reliability:

     A.  Fixed problem that sometimes caused crash when Setuuo to talk to a
         job (.Sttlk) was executed for a job in the process of logging out.

     B.  Fixed problem that caused crash when CORE command deleted Hiseg.

     C.  Fixed problem that caused crash or bogus device name to be printed
         when address check error message was necessary.

     D.  Fixed problem that caused crash when closing a file that was doing
         buffered i/o.  Solves XBASIC Getseg crashes.

     E.  Cleaned up ONCE dialog.  Removed all references to the obsolete
         swapping area.  Removed references to ONCDSK.

     F.  Fixed problem that caused bad pack set ID message to be printed
         when building a file structure from a virgin pack set.

     G.  Fixed problem that sometimes caused two frames looking at each
         other's address spaces to deadlock.

     H.  Fixed problem that caused job capacity exceeded not to zap port.

     I.  Only negotiate for block I/O ports if host is on a Tymnet base.
         That is, if system is a KI or KL.  This solves the problem Rainier
         Bank was having with block I/O negotiation.

     J.  Check for yellow ball arrived when Tinass UUO is issued to enable
         interrupt on receipt of yellow ball.  This prevents yellow ball
         races.

     K.  Fixed problem that caused creation of a frame to sometimes crash a
         KI when a particular hardware bug exists.  This solves PCOM
         induced crashes.



II.  Performance:

     A.  Removed some obsolete code and data structures.  This results in
         more space available for user programs.

     B.  Changed the way that some data structures are allocated so that
         the aggregate maximum number of files open on a system can be
         increased.

     C.  Make old style file I/O use VMOVPG (see below) to improve its
         efficiency.

III.  New Features and Changes:

     A.  Added POP command.  POP attaches a user to his parent (if any) and
         logs out the current job.

     B.  Added TALK GAN command to allow a user to talk to everyone in his
         GAN if he is the account supervisor or has OP license.

     C.  Added PCOM and DCOM commands to run Pcom and the PEAK command to
         run the Peak editor.

     D.  Added capability to scale the TRU.  XCHARG function 7 was
         implemented to allow the user to set scale factors.

     E.  Changed UNDEL command to UNDELETE.

     F.  Removed PCHECK command.

     G.  Added capability to display incremental frame data with ^T.  The
         capability can be enabled and disabled with the TTY [NO] RTCOMP
         command and Auxcal 101.

     H.  Added inactivity timeout capability.  Once-a-minute a counter is
         incremented for every frame.  A frame's counter is cleared when
         that frame becomes active.  Frames that exceed a set limit are
         evicted if so enabled, otherwise they are killed.  The limit can
         be set with the SET AUTOLOGOUT <minutes> command and cleared with
         the SET NOAUTOLOGOUT command.  Also, it can be modified with Calli
         -146, or set to a default (15 min.) with privilege bit lh 400.
         Gettab -55 was added to read the inactivity word.

     I.  Updated several messages to refer to frames instead of jobs.

     J.  Replaced "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message with the more explanatory
         "I/O error on file FILNAM.EXT".

     K.  Give a "!" as prompt if PDP mode is in effect and any license is
         set.

     L.  Added Frmop 41 (Stop Frame).  This allows a ^C to be simulated on
         a frame.

     M.  Added Frmop 42 to allow a command to be forced on a frame plus the
         new Frmop error code 37 (illegal command).

     N.  Added Frmop 43 to allow a project code for a frame to be changed.

     O.  Added new style .Focfm (Create Frame) to allow Loginn to be run in
         child and to allow license to be passed to child.

     P.  Copy project code from parent to child in Create Frame.

     Q.  Added frame fail stop (Calli -147) and frame fail exit (Calli
         -142) and associated error codes.

     R.  Added Chanio function 47 (Vmovpg).  This is the capability to move
         a private page into a file.

     S.  Added new Close flag 200 to set file dumped bit.  This allows TITO
         to set file dumped bit without having to do a Rename and
         potentially changing some other RIB data.

     T.  Changed Attach to require that the target have less or the same
         frame license as the source in order for the attach to succeed.

     U.  Changed Setlic so that the requested read and write privileges are
         not zeroed if they are greater than the corresponding frame
         license entries.

     V.  Added new mail waiting bit JP.MAI (1B8) in privlege word to
         indicate that new mail is waiting.  This allows a new mail system
         to be implemented without confusing users of the old system.

     W.  Added new Hang flag (1B13) to hard kill a frame without detaching.

     X.  Widened terminal ID code (TIC) field to 5 bits.

     Y.  Allow ATTACH and RETACH UUOs to force target frame to RUN state if
         desired.
