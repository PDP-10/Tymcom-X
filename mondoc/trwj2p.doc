Significant changes to TYMCOM-X between P034/J and P034/P

  I.  Reliability

    A.  Uptime (crash causes eliminated)
        1.  Hang while attempting to shut down the system.
        2.  XBASIC and PASCAL closing channel 0 from monitor context.
        3.  2020 problem recovering from ECC correction at end of cylinder.
        4.  PASCAL creating files with bad RIBS.
        5.  Zapper problem on PTYs in block IO mode.
        6.  Too many files open and too little freecore available.
	7.  TALK message to a frame in the process of logging out.
	8.  CORE command clearing an active user high-segment.
	9.  Address error using previous context registers causing an
	    executive page map failure.
       10.  GETSEG which destroyed I/O state while performing old-style
	    buffered I/O.  [XBASIC]
       11.  Mapping pages into a file in a directory that is over quota.
       12.  Releasing (removing) context pages for another frame.
       13.  Improper output on bad port with garbaged LDBOUT bits.
       14.  Catch loop in DDB linkages which caused a system hang.
       10.  Bad page map when job is requeued twice within one clock tick.
       11.  Using up freecore by not deallocating shared pages correctly.

    B.  New STOPCD (stop-code) reporting and recovery system.
	STOPCDs are now categorized into several types.  STOP, CPU, HALT and
	DISK cause the system to crash or reload.  JOB, EVENT and INFO print
	available information on the CTY and continue normal system operation
	without causing the system to crash or reload.

    C.  Operational Efficiency

	1.  Modified ONCE and ONCDSK commands and messages to aid the
	    operations staff in performing the correct functions.
	2.  Fixed pack-set ID on virgin packs during a system re-build.
	3.  Removed all code referring to obsolete SWAP space when a
	    refresh or rebuild is required for a pack-set or strucure.
	4.  Amplified many console messages during system restart.
	5.  Added the NETWORK command and modified operation of CONSOLE
	    command in ONCE to flag the use of TYMNET (default) or the
	    CTY when bringing the system up in any available mode.
	6.  Allowed CHANGE SYSTEM on hosts with micro-node bases to set
	    the system number between 1 and 99999.  Affects KS-10 & F3.
	7.  Changed CONSOLE mode to allow all commands to be entered
	    in either upper or lower case.  Added (^Z?) help message.
	8.  Force updating of the home pages as an integral part of a
	    REFRESH to avoid inconsistancy problems at system startup.

     D.  Eliminated the SPARE-LDB and it's myriad of associated problems.

     E.  Fixed many  port backpressure problems.
	 1.  New backpressure algorithm to help prevent character lossage.
	 2.  Fix input and skip AUXCALs to not go into OUTPUT wait forever.
	 3.  Allow the input line to exceed the maximum length.

     F.  Modify WSCTL call to not change the user working set status while
         performing a read operation.

     G.  Catch interrupts which previously were lost while sleeping using
         the HIBER UUO.

     H.  Make AUXCAL 10 (.AXSIC) work correctly with RESCAN, similar to
         SKPINC (TTCALL 13) for command ports.

     I.  Added new hang flag to hard-kill a frame without detaching.


 II.  Performance

    A.  Speed improvement
	1.  Added CHANIO 47 (.CHVMP) to map a private page into a file.

    B.  Frame handling UUOs
	1.  Added FRMOP 41 (.FOSTP) to simulate an <ESC> on a frame.
	2.  Added FRMOP 42 (.FOFCF) to force a special command.
	3.  Added FRMOP 43 (.FOCPC) to change the project code.
	4.  Added FLSTOP (CALLI -147) to stop with a halt status 4,,7.
	5.  Added FLEXIT (CALLI -142) to exit with a halt status 4,,2.
	6.  Fixed FRMOP 22 (.FOSVA) to read the start offset correctly.
        7.  Added access right 32 for passing license to another frame.

    C.  Changed FRMOP .FOCFM (Create Frame) to new a format which allows
	the changed privilege bits and license bits of the parent to be
	passed to the child frame.
	** Note: The next release of TYMCOM-X has added project code and
	network-origin information to the new .FOCFM format data block.

    D.  The frame INACTIVITY TIMEOUT feature is now fully implemented.  Any
	frame with this feature enabled will be logged off after a specified
	(or default) time limit in minutes, set by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT n"
	command or the SETINA (CALLI -146) or SETPRV (CALLI -11) monitor
	calls.  The currrent timeout may be read with .GTINA (GETTAB -55).
	In addition, this feature can be enabled automatically by setting
	the appropriate bit in the LUD.  A system-wide default may be set by
	an authorized user with the "SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY n" command.

    E.  Added Special Command Mode (SCM) to run the users Restricted
	Command Mode (RCM) program for un-recognized monitor commands.
	Settable with SETPRV (CALLI -11) and SETRCF (CALLI -57).  With
	this change the monitor command running the RCM or SCM will be
	found in SIXBIT in user register 1 to avoid a double rescan.

    F.  Added a micro-cycle timing clock to allow other Tymshare products
        to improve their performance.  CALLI -144 (SETMCY) was added to
        set the micro-cycle timer and interrupt type 15 was added to use
        the timer.

    G.  More dynamic allocation of internal data structures to take
	advantage of the expanding size of available memory.

    H.  Prevent race condition with yellow balls and interrupts.

    I.  The TRU limit for a job may now be set or extended by both the monitor
        command "SET LIMIT n" and the SETLIM UUO.  A frame my now request an
        interrupt when the TRU limit has been exceeded.


III.  Security

    A.  Added CL.DMP flag to CLOSE UUO for TITO to set the file-dumped bit
	without possibly losing data during an update.

    B.  Zap the current circuit when "frame capacity exceeded" is detected
	upon network LOGIN so as to prevent confusion.

    C.  Check frame license for same or greater capabilities in the source
	frame when attaching to another frame.

    D.  Return maximum current license on a file instead of none when an
	attempt is made to set greater file license.

E.  Give special (!) prompt instead of (.) in PDP mode when a user has
	any license set.

    F.  Prevent AUX CIRCUITS from logging into a SHUT system.

    G.  Fixed frame access rights checking routines to check child rights
	rather than parents rights where appropriate.

    H.  Added LOGOUT ON STOP feature to force a LOGOUT on a frame if it
	stops for any reason.  Set with SETPRV (CALLI -11).  May NOT be
	turned off once it is turned on.



IV.  Accounting

    A.  TRU scaling added for value-added and royalty products.

    B.  Fixed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to pass the project code to the child.

    C.  Fixed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to write an accounting record using the
	proper network-origin information for the newly created frame.


V.  Miscellaneous features

    A.  New or Changed commands
	1.  Added UNDELETE command to "undelete" files "deleted" with DIRIT.
	2.  Added XMAGNUM command to run (SYS)XMAGNUM.
	3.  Added the VUE command to run the VUE editor.
	4.  Added PCOM and DCOM command to run the PCOM program.
	5.  Deleted the obsolete PCHECK command.
	6.  Added USESTAT command to display incremental frame data.
	7.  Added TTY [NO] RTCOMP to allow (^T) to force USESTAT on a
	    running frame.  [Only works in PDP mode] (AUXCAL 101).
	8.  SET [NO]AUTOLOGUT to set or clear INACTIVITY TIMEOUT time.
	9.  TALK GAN to allow OPER (OP license) or an account supervisor
	    to issue a TALK message to all users in the appropriate GAN.
       10.  Changed the DAYTIME command to print the time zone after the time.

    B.  Miscellaneous
	1.  Add internal counters for OHT disk-page processing.
	2.  Provide better handling of own %UPT lock.
	3.  Update various text messages to refer to frames.
        4.  Added CHNIO function 46 (.CHNXT) to get the next free channel.
	5.  Correct the CHANIO function range check.
	6.  Handle page argument of -1 for various mapping calls.
	7.  Increase the network terminal ID code (TIC) field to 5 bits.
	8.  Change monitor "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message to "I/O ERROR".
	9.  Allow ATTACH UUO to simulate a continue command upon attach.
       10.  Correct misplaced scanner timing routines to use the proper
	    locations so that users may GETTAB their values.
       11.  Added entries for new tymnet terminal types.
       12.  Enlarged baud rate field from 3 to 4 bits for Tymnet specifications.
       13.  Added AUXCAL 100 (.AXTTP) to set sixbit terminal type.
       14.  Define a new error class 3 subtype to be called when an illegal
            CALL parameter is given, HT.CAL (4).

    C.  Processor specific changes
	1.  Modified interrupt table initialization for KS processors.
	2.  Don't negotiate BLOCK I/O ports on KS and F3 micronode bases.
	4.  Fix clock-timer during ONCE/FILES when refreshing a KS disk.
