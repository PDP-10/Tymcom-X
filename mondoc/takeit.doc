Abstract:

The primary  function of TAKEIT  is to provide  a means for  orderly and
automated takedown of a Tymcom-X system.

TAKEIT also provides several utility functions allowing the  operator to
control  timesharing and  selectively remove  users or  groups  of users
without necessarily  taking the  system down. When  the system  is being
taken down, TAKEIT will periodically notify users of the time remaining.
It also provides for a grace period to allow users to finish  editing or
other critical tasks. An automatic takedown normally requires  no action
from the operator once  started, however, any amount of  manual override
may be exercised at any time.

                               Chapter I                                

                              Introduction                              




The primary purpose of TAKEIT is to allow the operator  to automatically
bring timesharing to an orderly  halt on any Tymcom-X. The  program also
provides various utility functions which may be used even if  the intent
is not to stop timesharing. The program is thus considered to operate in
two modes, Automatic Mode and Manual Mode.



I.1    Manual Mode        

When the program is in  manual mode, it responds only to  commands given
by the operator. This mode requires very little  initialization dialogue
to  get  into  and  is  thus  useful  for  removing  "stuck"   jobs  and
miscellaneous other  features. A partial  list of manual  mode functions
include:
    1)  Removing a single job or group of jobs
    2)  Changing the system schedule (states)
    3)  Sending messages to users
    4)  Setting ONCE, DSKCLN or BOOTS options for next bring-up (WC)
        *
    5)  Having logins and logouts reported in real time
    6)  Clearing SCHPRV or JACCT for a single job (WC)
    7)  Crashing the system for diagnostic purposes (WC)
    8)  Hanging the system by hand
    9)  Detaching selected jobs
    10)  Attaching to selected jobs (WC)
    11)  Griping (reporting bugs)
Certain functions have been omitted since, although available  in manual
mode, make little sense to use there.



I.2    Automatic Mode        

When  the program  is placed  in automatic  mode, TAKEIT  will  begin to
control  the  takedown  process  automatically.  The  operator  will  be
required to  enter data describing  the takedown such  as when,  how and
why.  The  automatic command  is  most  often used  to  place  TAKEIT in
automatic  takedown  mode. (see  Section  III.1) The  reload  command is
actually a  special case of  the automatic command  and is also  used to
enter this mode.

I.3    Exempt Jobs        

Each job currently logged in is considered by TAKEIT to be either exempt
or non-exempt. If a job is exempt,
    1)  it will not appear in normal systat commands.
    2)  it  will not  be considered  by TAKEIT  when  continuing the
        grace period
    3)  it will not be killed except at the end of the  grace period
        or by  a kill  command which  explicitly specifies  "ALL" or
        "EXEMPT".
    4)  it  will  not  be  acted  upon  by  commands  which  do  not
        explicitly specify "ALL" or "EXEMPT".

A job is exempt if it meets any of the following:
    1)  user PJ running PAM
    2)  a job with device ACT: assigned (CHKPNT)
    3)  the job running TAKEIT
    4)  any job declared to  be exempt with the exempt  command (see
        Section VI.2)

The job which is running TAKEIT is super-exempt.  That is it will not be
effected by any command.  Note that  the proper way to "wait" for  a job
is to make it immune (see Section VI.3).



I.4    Immune Jobs        

Any  job may  be declared  immune or  unimmune by  command  (see Section
VI.3).   A  job  which  is immune  will  be  protected  from  any action
(manual  or  automatic)  by  TAKEIT.  If  an  automatic  takedown  is in
progress,  the grace  period will  be extended  indefinitely  untill all
immune jobs  log out  of their own  accord or  are declared  unimmune by
command.  This  feature is  useful for allowing  certain jobs  to finish
before taking the system down.  Immune jobs will be so marked  in systat
output.  Only TALK, SEND , SYSTAT and UNIMMUNE commands will work  on an
immune job.



I.5    Job-Spec Syntax        

Many TAKEIT commands require an argument describing a group of jobs upon
which to act.  The syntax  for this argument is called a  job-spec.  The
job-spec is a list of  specifications separated by blanks.  Each  of the
specifications denotes  a set  of jobs.  The  union of  all of  the sets
given on the command line is the set which is acted upon by the command.
That is  to say, any  job which is  to be acted  upon, must  satisfy the
criteria of each and every specification.  Therefore, the  command "KILL
2 3" will do  nothing since there are no  jobs which are both job  2 and
job 3.  Appendix D  shows a copy of  the job-spec help file  obtained by
typing a "?" in place of a job-spec.

Tymshare, Inc.                 Chapter I               TAKEIT version 36


The  specifications  which  may  be given  are  any  combination  of the
following:
    (username)             all jobs logged in to the given user name
    [gan,uun]              all  users  with  given   Global  Account
                           Number and Universal User Number *
    [gan,*]                all users  with the given  Global Account
                           Number
    job#                   the job with the given job number
    queue                  all jobs in the given queue or state
    device:                all jobs with the given device init'd
    ALL                    all jobs (including exempt jobs)
    EXEMPT                 all exempt jobs
    NONEXEMPT              all non-exempt jobs
    IMMUNE                 all immune jobs
    NONIMMUNE              all non-immune jobs
    IDLE                   all idle jobs
    DETACHED               all detached jobs
    WAIT                   all  jobs for  which the  user  affirms a
                           confirmation message
The  lack of  either "ALL"  or "EXEMPT"  will imply  "NONEXEMPT".  (i.e.
unless otherwise specified, only non-exempt jobs are affected)

Below are some annotated examples:
    KILL 5 (SMITH)         kills job 5 if and only if it  belongs to
                           user SMITH and is non-exempt
    KILL TO DETACH         kills all jobs which are detached,  in TO
                           state and non-exempt
    KILL <SYSTAT> ALL      kills  all  jobs  showing  a  job-name of
                           SYSTAT

Since all commands  implicitly exclude the  job running TAKEIT  from the
set of jobs being acted  upon, commands such as those below  become more
useful.
    KILL ALL               Kill all jobs but me
    KILL RN                Kill all jobs that are running (but me)

                         Overview of Operation                           




The  TAKEIT program  is restricted  to those  operators who  have either
Write-Core (WC) or Hang-User (HU) license. It is otherwise  available by
giving the command
        .R TAKEIT



II.1    Giving your Oper Name           

If you do not have  Write-Core (WC) license currently set for  your job,
TAKEIT will ask for  an Oper Name. At  this point, you should  enter the
name given to you by your  manager for use in setting licenses.  This is
not to be confused with the  name given to you by Customer  Services for
use in logging  in, or with  the name given to  you by your  parents for
people to call you by.  The name will be looked up in  the oper-password
file and checked for the necessary license(s).

Next  you  will be  asked  to supply  your  Oper Password.  This  is the
password associated with  the Oper Name  you just entered.  The password
will not echo.


II.1.1    Oper Command           

The oper command is used to change the oper name (and license) currently
in effect.  This is useful  if it becomes necessary to use  some command
which  requires  more license  than  is associated  with  the  oper name
supplied  originally.   TAKEIT  asks the  user  to  supply  the password
associated with the name given  in the command.  If this  command fails,
the license previously in effect will be retained.



II.2    Entering Commands         

TAKEIT  is  purposely  designed  without  a  command  prompt.   You  may
therefore assume that TAKEIT is waiting for you to type a command unless
it is obviously doing  something or has asked  for you to wait.   If you
become bewildered at some point and need to be assured that  the program
is still alive, simply type a control-T (^T). (see Section V.3)

Note that TAKEIT seldom allows you to type commands or  answers "ahead",
in order to minimize the danger of unintentional damage due to  a typing
error.

II.3    Leaving the Program          

The proper way to exit from the program is to give the quit command.  If
the program is in automatic  mode, the quit command will  be ineffective
until after the cancel command (see Section VI.9) has been given.



II.4    Response to Console Interrupts           

If  TAKEIT receives  a  control-C or  escape  while waiting  for  you to
complete a command or respond to a query, it will abort the  command and
return to TAKEIT command level.



II.5    Response to being killed           

TAKEIT runs with  JACCT on which causes  the monitor to protect  it from
any external force  which would cause it  to stop.  TAKEIT  also enables
the NTQ  interrupt (notice to  quit).  If another  job attempts  to kill
TAKEIT, it will receive the  NTQ interrupt and will respond  by aborting
the takedown in a prompt and orderly manner.



II.6    Response to Command Port Disconnect            

If the program notices that its command port has been zapped, presumably
due to the connection being lost, it will detach and continue to  run as
if  the  operator had  given  the detach  command.  (see  Section VII.3)
This will occur regardless of the jobs detach on disconnect or logout on
disconnect option in its job  privilege word.  The takedown will  not be
affected by such a disconnect.  If the system is super-shut, TAKEIT will
shut it before detaching.



II.7    Reattaching to a Detached TAKEIT            

A TAKEIT program that is  detached for any reason (see Section  II.6 and
VII.3) may be reattached to by any of
    1)  logging into the same username and giving the job  number of
        TAKEIT to the login program
    2)  logging into the same  username and giving the  ATTACH <job>
        monitor command
    3)  logging  into  any  username  and  giving  the  ATTACH <job>
        monitor command with Jacct-Login (JL) license set
    4)  logging into  any username, running  TAKEIT with  write core
        (WC) license and giving the command ATTACH <TAKEIT>

Once TAKEIT has  been attached to, it  will print a welcome  message and
ask the operator to confirm his intention of attaching to that  job.  If



                                   5
Tymshare, Inc.                Chapter II               TAKEIT version 36


the operator does so  confirm, he will be  asked to supply an  oper name
and oper password.  This will happen regardless of the fact that the job
might have (or  have had) Write-Core (WC)  license.  The oper  name must
have  at  least  Hang-User  (HU)  license  or  Write-Core  (WC)  license
associated with it else the job will detach itself again and continue to
run.  The  name does  not need to  match the  name originally  given (if
any).

Once this ordeal  is over, TAKEIT will  print a brief status  report and
enter  command  mode.  The  takedown  is not  affected  by  attaching or
detaching in this manner.  If the system was super-shut when  TAKEIT was
detached from, it will be automatically super-shut at this point.



II.8    Log of Actions on CTY            

Immediately  prior to  a  HANG or  CRASH (either  manual  or automatic),
TAKEIT will send  a message to the  CTY device containing  the following
information:
    1)  The reason for takedown
    2)  The username (or oper-name) of the user running TAKEIT
    3)  The date and time

Occasional very severe error messages from TAKEIT may also appear on the
CTY.  Most of these are cryptic and indicate extreme illness.

                      Phases of Automatic Takedown                         




Once  automatic  takedown  mode  has  been  entered  with  the automatic
command, it will proceed based on a countdown set by the  operator.  The
countdown represents the number of minutes left before ystem should
come down.  After  the countdown passes  zero (0) and  becomes negative,
the takedown is said to be in the grace period.



III.1    Initialization Phase          

The initialization  phase is  begun by the  automatic command  or reload
command   (see   Section   VI.1  and   Section   ).    The   purpose  of
this phase is to obtain  and verify all of the variables  concerning the
takedown:
    1)  the initials or name of the operator
    2)  the reason the system is going down
    3)  the time the system is to go down
    4)  the length of the grace period
    5)  the name of the file to reload the monitor from
    6)  the method of taking the system



III.2    Countdown Phase          

Once the automatic command has been given and the operator confirms, the
takedown  enters the  countdown phase.   During this  time,  TAKEIT will
periodically warn all users of the time remaining in the  countdown (see
Section  III.2.2).   *  It  will  also  update  the  file SYS:ACCESS.MSG
every minute  to inform new  users of the  time left.  The  program will
enable watching as if the  operator had given the watch  enable command.
This will cause  the operator to be  notified of all logins  and logouts
occurring during this phase.

When the  countdown reaches  one (1)  minute, TAKEIT  will automatically
shut the system.


III.2.1    SYS:ACCESS.MSG           
The login program checks for the file SYS:ACCESS.MSG and if it is found,
types  its contents  during login.   TAKEIT uses  this file  to  cause a
message of the form
    System will leave timesharing in MMM minutes.
    System going down for fun. /me

* Periodic warning messages are issued automatically at 30, 10, 5,  2, 1
and 0 minutes.

Tymshare, Inc.                Chapter III              TAKEIT version 36


While  TAKEIT is  using this  file, it  renames any  previously existing
ACCESS.MSG file into  TAKEIT.MSG on SYS:.  The  file is renamed  back at
the end of the TAKEIT session.

If an automatic takedown is  terminated in an abnormal manner such  as a
system crash, the ACCESS.MSG may remain.  If when the system  is brought
up again, a message prints at login of the form
    System will leave timesharing in MMM minutes.
    System going down for fun. /me
then the message  must be removed by  hand after verifying that  it does
not apply.  This is done by
    1)  setting WF license
    2)  DELETE (SYS)ACCESS.MSG
    3)  RENAME (SYS)TAKEIT.MSG,(SYS)ACCESS.MSG ;okay if this fails


III.2.2    Warning Messages            
TAKEIT periodicly sends broadcast  messages to all terminals  during the
countdown phase.  These messages appear to the users as
    ;;OPR: - System will leave timesharing in MMM minutes.  /me
The messages  may also be  sent using the  warning command  (see Section
VI.10).



III.3    Grace Phase          

During automatic countdown, the grace phase or grace period occurs after
the countdown has  expired (become negative).   At the beginning  of the
grace period, TAKEIT  will automatically super-shut the  system.  During
the grace  period, TAKEIT will  wake up every  second and kill  all jobs
which are either
    1)  non-exempt, non-immune and idle; or
    2)  non-exempt, non-immune and detached

The grace period ends when one of the following events occurs:
    1)  all non-exempt jobs are logged off
    2)  the grace period time  limit is exceeded and no  immune jobs
        remain
At that time, all  jobs are killed and the  system is taken down  in the
manner  specified  in  the  automatic  command  (see   Section  VI.1.3).
Note that immune jobs  will extend the grace period  indefinitely, while
exempt jobs do not affect the grace period.

TAKEIT will provide a limited amount of help to the operator while he is
running TAKEIT.  As a general rule, if you don't know what to do  at any
point, type a question mark  ("?").  At command level, this  will invoke
the  brief help  file.  At  a  prompt, this  will give  a  more detailed
description of the information being requested and the options available
to the operator.



IV.1    Help Command         

The help  command may be  invoked by typing  either "?" or  "HELP".  The
command will produce a list  of all commands currently known  to TAKEIT.
The syntax of the list is as follows:
    COMmand (noise words) [{opt1|opt2}]{req1|req2}
The first three letters of the command name are capitalized  to indicate
that at  least three  characters are necessary  for TAKEIT  to recognize
this particular  command.  *  The words shown  in parenthesis  are noise
words that make  the meaning of the  command word clear.  These  are not
entered  as part  of the  command.  Anything  inside of  square brackets
("[]") is an optional argument  and may be omitted.  Anything  inside of
curly braces ("{}") is a  list of arguments, separated by  vertical bars
("|"), of which  one must be choosen.   The following commands  would be
valid given the above help line:
    COM REQ1
    COM OPT1 REQ2
    COMMAND OPT2 REQ2
    COMMA REQ2

See Appendix B for a copy of the version 36 help file.



IV.2    Instructions Command         

The  instructions  command  will  provide  a  relatively  verbose,  task
oriented help message concerning itself with those tasks most  likely to
be required.  It is not complete, but it is specific.  Appendix  C shows
the file obtained from the instructions command in version 36.







* each command may be shortened to its point of uniqueness.

IV.3    Question Mark as an Argument            

Giving a  question mark ("?")  in an argument  to many commands  (and in
answer to any prompt) will provide a further explanation of  the options
available at that point.

When in doubt, type question mark.



IV.4    Remark Command         

This command is used to annotate the printout or log.  The format is
    REMARK <text>
This message is placed in the log, and otherwise ignored.  This  is also
good for other comments such as
    REMARK Have to kill PJ because its stuck
    REMARK Maint. needs the system to swap boards.
    REMARK This is to test fast DSKCLN.



IV.5    Configuration Command         

Many of the attributes of  the TAKEIT program are determined  at compile
time by several switches defined in the source code.  Normally these are
things which  are of little  interest to the  user of the  program.  The
config  command  may be  given  to obtain  a  list of  the  compile time
parameters.  Below is a list of the parameters as they exist  in version
36:  These values are all subject to (and likely to) change!

The following  commands may  be used  by the  operator to  obtain status
information about the takedown process or about other jobs logged  in to
the  system.   These commands  are  available in  both  manual  mode and
automatic mode.



V.1    Systat Command        

The systat  command allows  the operator to  see the  state of  all jobs
logged in to the system.  In some respects, it is similar to  the systat
program,  however,  the  arguments are  different.   The  format  of the
command is
    SYSTAT                 defaults to SYSTAT NONEXEMPT HEADING
    SYSTAT <job-spec>      see Section I.5 about job-specs
    SYSTAT HEADING         provide a brief heading
    SYSTAT <job-spec> HEADING

If HEADING is requested, various parameters of the takedown are given in
a short  header.  Below is  a sample output  from the "SYSTAT  ALL HEAD"
command:

System answered.
0:44:45 remaining.
5 minutes grace.
System will be hung.
2 non-exempt jobs.
1  PJ            PAM     SL  DETACH  Exempt
2  OPER          CHKPNT  TI  DETACH  ACT:  Jacct  Ntq  Exempt
3  WRS           TAKEIT  RN  TTY74   Jacct  SchPrv  Exempt
4  WRS           AUXIO   SL  TTY77
5  OPER          WHO     ^C  TTY75
6  WRS           SLAVE   ^C  TTY72   SchPrv  Exempt

Following  each job  line  is a  list  of flags.   These  flags indicate
special attributes of the job:
    device:                Job has named device open or assigned
    Jacct                  Job  has Jacct  set  meaning it  is  in a
                           system-critical   process.   It   may  be
                           immune to KILL and DETACH.
    SchPrv                 Job has SchPrv  set meaning it  is locked
                           in the high  priority run queue.   It may
                           prevent other jobs from running.
    Ntq                    Job   is  enabled   for  notice   o  quit
                           interrupt.   It  will  be  evicted rather
                           than killed.

    Immune                 The  job  has been  declared  immune (see
                           Section I.4)
    Exempt                 The job is exempt (see Section I.3)
    (killed)               Job has  been killed  but has  not logged
                           out yet.
    (evicted)              Job has been  evicted but has  not logged
                           out yet.
    (halted)               Job has been halted but is still running.
See Section VII.5 on handling problem Jacct/Schprv jobs.

In  a default  systat, those  jobs marked  "Exempt" would  not  be seen.
(Section  I.3   explains  exempt  jobs,   see  also  Section   VI.2  and
15 for controlling exemptness)



V.2    Watch Command        

The  watch command  may  be used  to  enable and  disable  the automatic
reporting  of logins  and  logouts on  the terminal.   When  watching is
enabled, TAKEIT will  print a message on  the terminal each time  a user
logs in or out of the  system.  The message will contain his  job number
and user name.  The forms of the watch command are:
    WATCH                  indicate  if   watching  is   enabled  or
                           disabled
    WATCH ON               enable watching
    WATCH ENABLE           enable watching
    WATCH OFF              disable watching
    WATCH DISABLE          disable watching



V.3    Control-T Command        

The so-called control-T command is given by typing a control-T character
at command level.  TAKEIT will respond with the countdown  time followed
by a count of non-exempt jobs currently logged in.  This is  also useful
to verify that TAKEIT is alive and well and at command level.

There are  a group of  commands used to  control the  automatic takedown
process.  The first  and most important  is the automatic  command.  The
remainder of the commands are  used to manually control or  override the
automatic  takedown.   Some of  the  commands documented  here  are also
available outside of  automatic mode but  have little value  there.  See
Section III.1  for a  brief description of  the philosophy  of automatic
mode.



VI.1    Automatic Command         

The automatic command  is used to place  the program in  automatic mode.
It  provides  the  basic  takedown  information  to  the  program.  This
information includes:
    1)  the initials or name of the operator
    2)  the reason the system is going down
    3)  the time the system is going down
    4)  the length of the grace period (see Section III.3)
    5)  the name of the file to reload the monitor from
    6)  the method of taking the system down

There are two forms of the automatic command.  The long form consists of
merely
    AUTO
After giving  the long  form, all  of the  information is  prompted for.
When a piece of information is prompted for, the user may enter a "?" to
obtain an explanation of the current options.  This form  is recommended
for the beginner,  or infrequent user.  Appendix  E shows an  example of
the long form of the automatic command.

The short  form provides all  information on one  line.  The  short form
consists of
    AUTOMATIC <time>,<reason>
<time> and <reason> are  described below.  In this form,  all parameters
other than <time> and <reason>  are defaulted as indicated below  in the
appropriate section.

Following is an  explanation of all of  the parameters of  the automatic
command.


VI.1.1    Enter your initials            
This parameter is used to sign messages sent to the users on the system.
The default is your oper name (see Section II.1).  If you have not given
an oper name because you are running with write-core (WC)  license, then
the default is your login user name.

VI.1.2    Enter reason for takedown             
This parameter is a text  string that appears in the  SYS:ACCESS.MSG and
in  the first  broadcast  message to  users.  It  indicates  briefly the
reason the system  will be down.   It may also  be used to  indicate how
long the  system will be  down for.  The  operator has three  options in
reply to this prompt.
    1)  enter a <cr> to omit the message
    2)  enter a number 1-7 for one of the canned messages
    3)  enter the message up to 60 characters
The canned messages may  be seen by giving  a "?" reply.  In  Appendix E
one  can find  the list  of canned  reasons in  the example.   A message
entered here should be of the form
    System going down for ...
(i.e. they should be a complete sentence).


VI.1.3    Enter takedown type            
This is the takedown type or  method of takedown that will be  used when
the grace period expires.  Except in rare instances, this will be boots-
loaded, which is the default.  The options are:

    Boots-loaded           All jobs will be killed, the  system will
                           come  to an  orderly stop  and  leave the
                           console with boots loaded.

    Reload                 All jobs will be killed, the  system will
                           come to  an orderly stop  and immediately
                           resume timesharing running  the specified
                           monitor.   DSKCLN will  not be  run.  The
                           system is typically down for  about 50-90
                           seconds.

    Crash                  This  option is  only available  to users
                           with Write-Core  (WC) license.   All jobs
                           will  be  killed,  the  system   will  be
                           crashed  by  deposit  in  30.    This  is
                           intended  for  debugging  and emergencies
                           only!

    Stand-alone            All jobs will be killed, timesharing will
                           continue with the system super-shut.  The
                           job running TAKEIT  will be the  only job
                           logged in.  This is useful for  doing ASP
                           dumps, etc.

    Manual                 TAKEIT  will  take  no  action.   At  the
                           beginning  of  the  grace  period, TAKEIT
                           will  be  placed  in  manual  mode.   The
                           operator may then use TAKEIT  commands to
                           take the  system down  by hand.   No jobs
                           will be killed (unless by hand).

This may be changed during  automatic mode by giving the  action command
(see Section VI.6).

VI.1.4    Enter takedown time            
This parameter determines the initial value of the countdown.  It may be
entered as  either the local  time the  system is to  come down,  or the
elapsed time in minutes before the system is to come down.  To enter the
elapsed time, simply  enter the number of  minutes.  To enter  the local
time, type  an atsign  ("@") followed  by the  time of  day in  the form
hh:mm.  Either a  12 hour or  24 hour clock may  be used for  this time.
Some annotated examples (assume the local time is 16:30):
    @5:00                  30 minutes (PM assumed)
    @17:00                 30 minutes (24 hour clock used)
    @4:00                  11:30 minutes (AM assumed)
    120                    2:00 minutes (elapsed time given)
Users  without  Write-Core (WC)  license  are not  permitted  to specify
takedown times less than the default (which currently is 5 minutes).

The takedown time may be  changed while in automatic mode by  giving the
set command (see Section VI.4).


VI.1.5    Enter grace period            
The grace  time (see Section  III.3) is given  in minutes.  This  is the
maximum  amount  of  time  that the  system  will  remain  up  after the
countdown expires.  If the  user does not have Write-Core  (WC) license,
the  grace  period may  not  be set  lower  than the  default  (which is
currently 1 minute).

The length of the grace period may be changed while in automatic mode by
giving the grace command (see Section VI.5).



VI.2    Exempt and UnExempt Commands           

These commands are used to  turn on and off the exemptness  of otherwise
non-exempt  jobs.  (see  Section  I.3 for  a definition  of  exempt) The
command  takes a  job-spec  (see Section  I.5) as  its  argument.  These
commands are legal in both manual mode as well as automatic mode but are
documented here because this is where they are most often used.



VI.3    Immune and UnImmune Commands           

There commands  declare jobs  to be  immune or  unimmune.  All  jobs are
normally unimmune.   (see Section  I.4 for a  definition of  immune) The
command  takes a  job-spec  (see Section  I.5) as  its  argument.  These
commands are legal in both manual mode as well as automatic mode but are
documented here because this is where they are most often used.

VI.4    Set Command         

One may use the set command to enter a new countdown.  Caution should be
used when doing so as it may lead to great confusion on the part  of the
users.  If  possible, the hold  command should be  used in lieu  of set.
The  new countdown  will  take effect  immediately upon  giving  the set
command.   See Section  VI.1.4  for the  format of  the  countdown time.
Typing "SET  ?" will  give a brief  explanation of  the options  at that
point.  Note: shortening the  countdown without giving the  users proper
warning  is in  very poor  taste.  The  warning command  (Section VI.10)
may be used  after the set  command to make the  users aware of  the new
countdown.



VI.5    Grace Command         

The length of of the grace period (see Section III.3) may be  changed at
any point while in automatic mode by giving the grace command.  The form
is
    GRACE <minutes>



VI.6    Action Command         

The type of  action taken at  the end of  the grace period  (see Section
VI.1.3) may  be changed  by giving the  action command.   If no  type is
given, it will be prompted for.  An argument of "?" will display  a list
of options.  The forms are:
    ACTION Boots-loaded
    ACTION Reload
    ACTION Stand-alone
    ACTION Crash
    ACTION Manual
    ACTION ?
    ACTION



VI.7    Hold Command         

Often it  becomes necessary to  postpone the takedown  once it  has been
started.  The  hold command  provides a  simple means  to do  so without
canceling the takedown.  The effect of the command is to merely stop the
countdown.   The countdown  may be  resumed with  the  continue command.
Note:  if the takedown is to be postponed for a long period, it might be
more desirable to cancel the takedown and restart it later. (see Section
VI.9)  If  you  feel  that  the  users  should  be  notified   that  the
countdown  is holding,  use the  send command  or talk  command (Section
VII.2 Section VII.1).

VI.8    Continue Command         

The  continue command  is used  to restart  the countdown  after  a hold
command has been given.   It is often a  good practice to warn  the user
that the  countdown has  changed by issuing  a warning  command (Section
VI.10) after the countdown is resumed.



VI.9    Cancel Command         

The automatic takedown  may be canceled  by issuing the  cancel command.
TAKEIT will be  left in manual mode  by this command.  If  any broadcast
messages have been  sent, cancel will cause  another message to  be sent
indicating that "timesharing will continue until further  notice".  This
command basically  does not change  the state of  the system,  it merely
stops the automatic takedown wherever it happens to be.



VI.10    Warning Command          

The warning command will cause  the TAKEIT program to issue  a broadcast
message to all users warning them of the current countdown.  See Section
III.2.2 about warning  messages.  This command is  good to give  after a
change in the schedule of the takedown as a result of a hold/continue or
a set command.

The commands in this group are used to control other jobs.   The control
that may be exercised includes
    1)  detaching a job
    2)  logging out a job
    3)  sending messages to jobs
    4)  clearing SCHPRV (Scheduler Privilege) for a job
    5)  clearing JACCT (Job in critical state) for a job
All of the commands in this  group may be used in either  automatic mode
or manual mode.

All of  these commands take  as an argument  a job-spec.   Job-specs are
described  in Section  I.5.   For a  brief description  of  the job-spec
format, the user may give  any of these commands followed by  a question
mark.



VII.1    Talk Command          

The talk  command is exactly  like the monitor's  TALK command.   It has
three forms:
    TALK ALL <message>
    TALK JOB <job > <message>
    TALK TTY<tty >: <message>
The message received looks like
    ;;OPR: - <message>



VII.2    Send Command          

The send command  is used to send  messages to groups of  users.  Unlike
the talk command, it will support multiline messages.  The  send command
takes a job-spec  as an argument and  then prompts for the  message with
";;".  For example:
    SEND (USER)
    Enter message (end with ^D):
    ;; The body of
    ;; the message is placed here
    ;; taking as many lines as necessary.
    ;; ^D
    5 jobs     
The message should be ended with a control-D (^D).  The message  is sent
all at once  when the ^D  is typed.  Standard  line mode editing  may be
used to edit  the line being entered.   The message sent is  broken into
tokens and tokens are filled into 64 character lines.  This will prevent



                                   18
Tymshare, Inc.                Chapter VII              TAKEIT version 36


excessive  white space  in  messages as  well as  preventing  line wrap-
around.  The message received is of the form
    ;;message from OPR: (ME)...
    ;; The body of the message is placed here taking as many
    ;; lines as necessary.
Bells  are interspersed  liberally throughout  the message  to  wake the
sleeping user.

Beware!  This command will stop the clock while waiting for  the message
to be typed.  The user must never leave the terminal in the middle  of a
message for any extended period  of time (25 seconds is  the recommended
maximum).  The command may be  aborted by typing a control-C (^C)  or an
escape.

Any monitor level talk command given by another user specifying  OPR: as
the destination will be received by TAKEIT.  *

During the countdown, TAKEIT will automatically send  broadcast messages
warning the users of the time remaining.  (see Section III.2.2)



VII.3    Detach Command          

The  detach  command with  no  arguments will  detach  the  current job.
TAKEIT will  run completely  by itself  without a  terminal.  It  may be
reattached to at any time as described in Section II.7.

The detach command also serves to detach another job or group of jobs as
specified by the job-spec given as an argument.  The method of detaching
the job(s) is such that they  will continue to run with the  terminal in
user mode (if it was).  This  is useful if there is a job  running which
you would like to attach to  but you can't get at the terminal  in order
to detach it.



VII.4    Attach Command          

The  attach  command  allows  the user  to  attach  to  any  job without
affecting the state of  the job (i.e. if  it is running, it  will remain
running).  The command takes a job-spec as an argument.  The  TAKEIT job
that the command was issued to is aborted and logged out.   This command
is useful for attaching to jobs just detached by the detach command (see
Section VII.3).  This command requires write core (WC) license.







* Beware: if there are two jobs running TAKEIT simultaneously,  only one
of them (at random) will receive messages sent to OPR:

VII.5    Clear Command          

The clear command  is provided to handle  jobs which have  become stuck.
Due to  the delicate nature  of the command,  it is restricted  to those
with Write-core (WC)  license.  The effect is  to turn off any  of three
bits which are found on in the job status word (JbtSts).  The three bits
affected are
    1)  JACCT  (job in  critical process  - immune  to ^C,  hang and
        circuit zappers)
    2)  JACCT2 (immune to ^C)
    3)  SCHPRV (Scheduler  Privilege - may  prevent other  jobs from
        running)
It is beyond the scope  of this document to provide an  understanding of
the  implications of  each  of these  bits.  A  TYMCOM-X  monitor manual
(YAMM) should be consulted for this information.

The systat command (see Section V.1) will mark jobs with these  bits set
by showing the  name of the  bit at the end  of the line  describing the
job.



VII.6    Kill Command          

The kill command is used to remove jobs by forcing them to log out.  The
prefered way  to do  this to  a single  job is  by giving  the following
command
    KILL job  (username)
This will provide a  safety factor in the  event that the job  number is
incorrect or the user  has logged out of  his own will and  someone else
has logged in.

Note that if this command is used to kill the CHKPNT program, the system
will automatically be shut.  This is to prevent the alarm resulting from
running the system unshut without accounting.

TAKEIT will not kill itself, therefore, the command
    KILL ALL
is useful for making the system stand alone.

Note that TAKEIT will watch jobs that have been killed to see  that they
go away.  Should they not log out within a fixed period of  time, TAKEIT
will automatically kill them again.  A message will be typed to indicate
that  this is  happening.   This will  properly handle  jobs  which have
alternate logout programs set up which may be malicious or bug laden.

Below is the sequence followed by TAKEIT to kill a given frame (job):
    1)  EVICT the frame and wait  (up to 600 seconds) for  the frame
        to log  off.  If the  NTQ interrupt is  not enabled  for the
        frame or if the frame  does not log off within  600 seconds,
        proceed below.
    2)  HALT the frame
    3)  wait (up to 20 seconds) for the frame to halt.  If the frame
        has not halted after 20 seconds, repeat the HALT operation.


                                   20
Tymshare, Inc.                Chapter VII              TAKEIT version 36


    4)  remove the frame's page 0 if one existed
    5)  create a private page 0 for the frame
    6)  deposit a small program in the frame which will log it off
    7)  start the frame
    8)  wait (up to 600 seconds)  for the frame to log off.   If the
        frame  has  not logged  off  after 600  seconds,  repeat the
        process starting with the HALT.

The time limits for the three operations indicated above is  designed to
allow the job to properly respond under worst case conditions.  The user
is told he  has 60 seconds  of time (guaranteed) in  which to up  and go
away when  he receives  a notice to  quit or  when his  alternate logout
program is run.  These times are subject to change!

The commands  in this group  are the most  powerful commands  in TAKEIT.
They are used, with care,  to manually control the state  of timesharing
on the system.  The available functions are
    1)  answering, shutting and super-shutting the system
    2)  hanging the system (stopping timesharing)
    3)  crashing the system (WC) *



VIII.1    Schedule Command           

The schedule command is used exactly as the monitor schedule  command is
used.  In TAKEIT, however, the command will take both octal and mnemonic
arguments describing the desired state of the system.  The  command will
only allow the shut and super-shut bits to be controlled.  The syntax of
the command is
    SCHED ANswer
    SCHED SHut
    SCHED SUperShut
    SCHED 0
    SCHED 400000
    SCHED 600000
    SCHED

The last form  of the command will  merely display the current  state of
the system.

Note:  TAKEIT  keeps track  of  the state,  if  it notices  that  it has
changed,  it will  type a  message indicating  that some  other  job has
changed the state.



VIII.2    Hang Command           

The hang command is used to stop timesharing in an orderly  manner.  The
effects are relatively immediate.  TAKEIT will first kill all non-exempt
jobs.  When all non-exempt jobs are gone, it will kill all  exempt jobs.
When all jobs are gone (except TAKEIT), the system will be hung, leaving
the console with boots loaded.

Using this command with any users logged in is in poor taste.

VIII.3    Crash Command           

The crash command is used to  crash the system by deposit in 30  for the
purpose of debugging the monitor or hardware.  The command is restricted
to users with Write-Core (WC) license.  The effect of the command  is to
poke a non-zero word * into physical location 30 causing the  monitor to
crash at the next line frequency clock interrupt.  The monitor  does not
do any cleanup when crashing and thus the disks are left in an undefined
state (bad news).  In general this command is a loser and should only be
used when indicated by emergency procedures or for debugging.

Using this command with any users logged in is in poor taste.

Giving  the  instructions  command (see  Section  IV.2)  will  cause the
following file to be displayed on the users terminal in version 36.



For complete instructions, please see the TAKEIT manual.

To hang jobs, one at a time, as with HANGUP, use the command
        KILL job# (user)
where job# is the job number, (user) is the username of the job.
Other criteria may be given to kill a job or group of jobs, for
details, type "KILL ?".

To take the system down, in a courteous manner, use the command
        AUTO
and answer the questions as required.  If you are confused by a
question, type "?" and it will be explained in detail and reask.
This will automatically handle notification of users and shutting
the system.  Progress reports will be given.
