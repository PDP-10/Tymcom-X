P031 New Features            & New UUO's             January 26, 1977


                            Introduction.

P031  introduces  5   new  UUO's,  new  Project-Code   Facility,  and
accounting totally thru the "Stream" mechanism.
UUO CHPJC (Change Project Code) is CALLI AC,-61.
UUO PUTSAR (Put Stream Accounting Record) is CALLI AC,-62.
The GETTAB UUO has three new items:
        -44: returns in AC,AC+1 the double-precision microcycles
        -45: returns in AC,AC+1 the d.p. TRU's
        -46: returns in AC,AC+1 the d.p. kilo-core-microcycles

In  addition,  Restricted  Command  Mode  is  now  restricted  to the
following commands:  EXIT LOGOUT DETACH CONTINUE BYE HALT  (^C) KJOB,
the null  command (just a  CR), and the  following commands  from the
"forced command  table" in  SCNSER which  the user  may not  type but
which are required for monitor stability:  .LOGIN .FCONT INITIA.

The monitor command MODIFY,  formerly unavailable in PDP-10  mode, is
now available in both XEXEC and PDP-10 modes.

REASSIGN UUO DOES NOT PERFORM  A RELEASE OF THE REASSIGNED  DEVICE IF
THE CALLER IS REASSIGNING IT TO HIMSELF AND HAS IT INITTED ALREADY.

LOGINN,  LOGOUT, and  CHKPNT all  write records  into the  stream via
PUTSAR.  The "FACT" file no longer exists.  All accounting data is in
the "stream  files", (UN1)MMDDYY.SAT.  CHKPNT  is the only  writer of
.SAT files; if it cannot  update any given MMDDYY.SAT, it  creates an
alternate MMDDYY.S01.  No alternates past MMDDYY.S77 will be created.
MMDDYY is the GMT date.

LICENSE:        No license required to read PJC
                XC or WPJ license required to set PJC if PJCVFY=1
                No license required to set PJC and
                 PJCVFY if PJCVFY=0.
ERROR RETURN: On SET or SET BOTH, error return if no license

The function of PJCVFY is to  require setters of PJC to be XC  or WPJ
licensed,  as  some sort  of  assurance  that the  new  PJC  has been
verified properly.  If a user is not subject to verification,  do not
set  this  bit.   If  you do,  subsequent  setters  will  need  to be
licensed.  The current state of PJCVFY is returned with the PJC  on a
read call.

READ  function:   AC/ 0,,BLOCK.   Returns current  PJC and  PJCVFY in
Block. AC preserved.

SET   function:   AC/1,,BLOCK.  Set  PJC  from Block,  do  not change
PJCVFY.  Return previous PJC and PJCVFY in Block. AC preserved.

SET  BOTH function:   AC/3,,BLOCK.  Set  PJC and  PJCVFY  from Block.
Return previous PJC and PJCVFY in Block. AC preserved.

RECORDTYPES:

        22: CHKPNT REC  -- "       "
        23: LOGOUT REC  -- "       "
        24: UPTIME REC --  "       "

No  further recordtypes  defined at  present. If  others  are defined
later, they must be  .le. 377 in order  not to foul up  CHKPNT, which
uses  types .ge.  400 for  error and  control info  put in  SAT file.
Record  formats  are  fully  described  in  (MONDOC)STREAM.DOC.   THE
MONITOR WILL DATE-STAMP ALL  PUTSAR RECORDS; THEREFORE THEY  MUST NOT
RESIDE IN A READ-ONLY PAGE.




                    Extended LOOKUP ENTER RENAME

Three new words exist in extended UUO blocks:  words (octal) 35,36,37
contain the file's  Project-Code, format identical to  that described
above for  CHPJC UUO.   PJCVFY is  meaningless.  The  following rules
apply when doing an extended UUO with these new arguments:
1.  A Write-Files-Licensed user may set them on ENTER RENAME
        They will be returned on LOOKUP. ON CREATION OF
        ANY FILE, THE WF-LICENSED USER MAY SPECIFY THE
        PJC IN HIS ENTER BLOCK.
2.  A Write-Project-Licensed user may set them on RENAME or on
        any Update-mode ENTER.  They will be returned on a
        Create-mode ENTER and on LOOKUPs.  At Creation,
        the current session PJC is placed in the RIB and
        returned to the user.
3.  A user without WF or WPJ may not set these values.  They
        will be returned on ENTER LOOKUP. Attempts to change
        them with RENAME will result in no change.
        At creation of a file, the current session PJC is
        placed in the RIB and returned to the user.

In UFD lookup blocks, the PPN/filename/ext/class code found
in words 35-37 are used by LOGINN and (SYS)PROJEC.SAV to
determine what type of PJC verification to enforce, if any:

                      XCHARG UUO NEW FUNCTION 4

XCHARG  UUO  now will  perform  a reset  of  selected  TRU components
accepting component values directly  from the caller.  XC  license is
required.    Component  values   offered  must   lie  in   the  range
(Saved,Current).  Component values  lying outside this range  will be
ignored  and  an error  return  given.  This  UUO  also  performs the
equivalent of  XCHARG function  0 as  it executes  successfully.  The
call is:
CALL:   MOVE AC,[-LENGTH,,BLOCK]        ;ARGUMENT BLOCK
        XCHARG AC,

        ELSE NO CHANGE TO CURRENT & SAVED, REPORT ERROR"
FOR EACH COMPONENT WHOSE BITMASK BIT=0:  NO CHANGE TO
        CURRENT OR SAVED VALUES.

When XCHARG function 4 gives a failure return code of 3 in  AC 33-35,
bits 0-32 of  AC contain 1's wherever  a bad component  was detected.
That component was not touched by the XCHARG.

DOUBLE-PRECISION VALUES: NOTE:  The 1st bit of a pair of bits  in the
bitmask which signify a  double-precision component is the  one which
XCHARG tests.  If the 1st bit is 0, both will be considered 0, and if
it is 1, both will be assumed to be 1.  No error is generated  if the
bits do not have the same value.

Proper use  of new XCHARG  function 4:  the  user should first  do an
XCHARG function 0, SAVE  CHARGES.  He should then read  saved charges
into one  array, read  current charges into  a second  array, perform
whatever calcualtion is appropriate  to derive a value  between these
two limits for components of interest, and then do an XCHARG function
4 with a bitmask whose 1's signify the components of  interest.  Note
that function  4 requires  each component  to be  in its  proper word
position in the  argument block, as  indicated in the  section above.
This  is  achieved  by  specifying a  bitmask  of  777777,,0  (all 18
components)  in the  "Read Saved"  and "Read  Current"  functions and
doing the calculations in place in the "Read Saved" array.




                         The CHKPNT WATCHDOG

Since all accounting is now done via the stream mechanism, it becomes
vital  that CHKPNT  run  at all  times.   If CHKPNT  does  not answer
requests to empty the ACT device buffer, the system grinds to  a halt
as  more &  more processes  go  into wait  for space  to  write their
records to the ACT device.

A Watchdog  has been  installed in  the monitor  which runs  once per
minute and checks to be sure the ACT device is being serviced.  A new
bit in the STATES word records the status of stream activity; the bit
is called STMDED, and is 1 if the Watchdog has decided that CHKPNT is
dead for any reason.
Here is what the Watchdog does:
1. If the system is open for timesharing (not restarting,
        Shut, or Super-shut) and yet no job has the
        ACT device initted, then the message
          "SYSTEM UN-SHUT WITHOUT ACCOUNTING
P031 New Features            & New UUO's             January 26, 1977


           LOG IN TO 'OPER' AND 'R CHKPNT'  "
        is written on the operator TTY and console
        CTY, the CTY bell is set to ringing, and the ACT
        device Unhappy Bit in ALR620 is set.
   In normal operation the ACT device is kept assigned
   by console to the CHKPNT job at all times, even
   when CHKPNT does a RELEASE UUO and/or EXIT to the monitor.
   Thus this message will appear only if: 1) someone
   hangs the CHKPNT job; 2) someone attaches to the job and
   logs it out; or 3) someone attaches to the job
   and enters the DEASSIGN ACT command.
2. If the job (CHKPNT) to which ACT is assigned has hit an
        error condition which set JERR in JBTSTS, then
        the message
         "CHKPNT PROGRAM FATAL ERROR.
          'R CHKPNT' AFTER ATTACHING TO JOB <XX> "
        is send to operator TTY and console CTY (or just
        to CTY if no operator TTY), the CTY bell is set
        ringing, the stream mechanism is declared DEAD by
        setting the STMDED bit in STATES, and the system
        is SHUT.

Note that the system is SHUT in case 2, because the ACT-owner  job is
not runable and the ACT  buffer will quickly fill up.  New  users are
prevented from logging in.  However an operator (with  shut override)
can log into OPER (which attaches him to the CHKPNT JOB),  and re-run
CHKPNT, which un-shuts the system as it re-initializes.

CHKPNT will  also clear  the STMDED  bit when  it is  un-shutting the
system.  Before CHKPNT  re-initializes and  begins servicing  the ACT
device,  the  system  will  appear hung  to  all  users  except those
(normally OPER) which  log in after this  state has been  reached and
whose AUN  matches that of  the CHKPNT job.   Any OPER job  which was
trying to access the ACT  device to write a record before  the STMDED
bit went on will also appear hung.

For a further discussion of this please see (MONDOC)ERRMSG.031.




                      Changes to LOGINN, LOGOUT

These have  been changed  in two  areas:  all  references to  the old
APPEND package,  which implemented writing  to the "FACT"  files, are
removed,  and  a  call  to PUTSAR  is  substituted.   If  PUTSAR fail
returns, they write  a message on  the operator terminal  via SETUUO.
P031 New Features            & New UUO's             January 26, 1977


For this they have been  given OP license.  PUTSAR FAIL CODE  0 MEANS
SYSTEM IS  UP FOR  FREE. OTHERWISE  IF CHKPNT  IS DEAD,  PUTSAR WAITS
UNTIL IT  IS REVIVED BEFORE  SUCCESS/FAIL RETURNING TO  LOGOUT.  This
ties up  a job number  even though  the user may  hang up  his phone.
When CHKPNT is  re-initialized, LOGOUT will  write its record  to the
stream, then give up the job slot and circuit via the LOGOUT UUO.

The second area of change is in LOGINN and implements  the validation
of  Project-Codes  on Login.   Please  refer to  the  section "Design
Notes, PJC Facility" if the following is unclear:

1. Before running any Init  file designated by the LUD,  LOGINN first
checks the 3 locations in the user's UFD RIB which contain info about
his classification for PJC's.  These cells are in the extended lookup
block left after Loginn has run its routine UFDSET.

2.  If the cells indicate a class 0 user (no validation), LOGINN goes
ahead & RUN's any init file, or else just exits.

3.  If  a Class 1  user is indicated,  the PPN/FN in  the cells  is a
program to run which will do validation.  In most cases this  will be
a custom program written by the field or by the customer Acct. Super.
LOGINN  RUN's this  program  at entry+1,  passing  to it  a  bunch of
registers full of dandy  info, such as the  name of the INIT  file to
run once PJC validation is finished.  LOGINN sets  Restricted Command
Mode and the indicated  PPN/FN as the Restricted  Command File,before
the RUN.

4.  If a Class 2 user is indicated, the PPN/FN point to a hash table.
LOGINN does a RUN(entry+1) on (SYS)PROJEC, passing a register-load of
stuff including this PPN/FN.  PROJEC looks in this file for  the PJC.
PROJEC is  the RCF and  user is  in RCM, analagously  to class  1. JL
LICENSE IS PASSED BY  LOGINN TO (SYS)PROJEC, ONLY; IT  IS IMMEDIATELY
THROWN AWAY.  IF A USER PROGRAM DOES RUN UUO, ENTRY+1 ON (SYS)PROJEC,
JL WILL BE MISSING, AND THE PROGRAM EXITS WITH A MESSAGE.




                     Design Notes, PJC Facility

These  are intended  as casual  design notes  and  overall philosophy
description.  Relevant reading: Tymcom-X Project-Code Facility Users'
Guide, and VALID: TYMCOM-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility.

The facility is  secure against all  users without WPJ  license.  The
VALID program must  have WF and  ST (structure) license.   It reduces
P031 New Features            & New UUO's             January 26, 1977


license to  WPJ and  ST at initialization.   The PROJEC  program must
also have WF,  and it lowers license  to WPJ.  This  technique allows
these files to  exercise WPJ rights in  the callers' GAN  even though
they reside in SYS.

VALID  needs ST  to do  UFD interlocking.   Monitor  changes (CHKWRT,
FILFND) allow WPJ-licensed caller to RENAME UFD's, which is how VALID
records class info in the user's UFD.  VALID requires its  callers to
have ACCT SUP status or TYMSHARE PROPRIETARY status.

PROJEC needs WPJ in order to change PJC for users whose PJCVFY=1, and
to be able to change PJC in a file RIB via extended RENAME.

All user hash tables in  PROJ.COD files need WPJ license  not because
it is exercised but as a certification of validity to PROJEC that the
(unlicensed) user has  not written on the  file. (Such a  write would
destroy the license.)

The hash tables are set up  by VALID with a variable number  of pages
depending on how  many codes arebe hashed  in.  The code  uses a
"Load Factor" of  67%--it will choose a  number of pages to  use such
that the absolute maximum  capacity times load factor is  .ge. number
of  entries to  be made.   Typically users  will have  a  1-page hash
table.   Entries are  3 words.   Words 0,1,2  of the  table  have the
following  info:  number  of  pages of  table, number  of  entries in
table, and the prime number used in putting them in.

The  hash is  essentially D.  Knuth, Vol  3 p521,  algorithm  D, with
provision  for  3-word  entries.   Open  addressing  with  collisions
resolved by secondary hash.  Collisions don't seem to happen  much in
testing,  and  more than  2  secondary probes  are  rarely necessary,
especially with  the load factor  at 67%.  The  load factor  could be
changed by redifining a symbol in VALID.

If applications ever  come up requiring  capacities in excess  of 650
entries in  a table, another  entry can be  added to PRMTAB  in VALID
using prime=largest prime .le. (number of pages times ^d512  all over
3).

PROJEC looks up proffered PJC's  in these hash tables using  the same
algorithm by which they were put there, except PROJEC  never modifies
the hash table.   PROJEC reads page  0 of the  hash table to  get the
control info which tells it  how many more pages to read,  what prime
to use in hashing, and when to conclude that the proffered PJC is not
there (Rare case if table were precisely full).

PROJEC runs in RCM with  itself as RCF and escape  interrupt enabled,

when run  by LOGINN.   The user is  thus unable  to exit  the program
except by  giving a  valid PJC, logging  off, or  hanging up.   If he
hangs up, DETACH is a  legal RCM command, so the monitor  will detach
or disconnect him.  Under some error conditions, PROJEC will initiate
a logout, only if run by LOGINN.  Similar conditions arising during a
regular user-initiated run just exit to the system.

Whereas LOGINN is responsible for noticing whether a user is  class 1
or 2 and running PROJEC only for class 2, PROJEC must notice  this on
a user-initiated RUN.  So if a class 1 user types .PROJECT  BLAH BLAH
the system goes thru 2 steps to get him to the proper  program: first
run PROJEC, which in turn runs the program pointed to in his UFD RIB,
presumably a  custom-validation program written  by his  Acct. Super.
and residing in the A.S.  directory.

Such customomer-written validation  programs (lets call  them SUPERV)
may  be written  in  FORTRAN.  To  give SUPERV's  the  flexibility to
accept register-loads  of arguments from  LOGINN, etc., we  provide a
MACRO driver program which is loaded before the FORTRAN  main program
and which  calls it  after saving info.   The driver  is also  a main
program.  Trickery with the  Loader command string enables  loading 2
mains.

We presume that SUPERV's will want to mimic the external  behavior of
PROJEC as much as possible to reduce confusion.  We do not  place any
restrictions on how they validate a PJC, however.
