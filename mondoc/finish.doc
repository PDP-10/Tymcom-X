   SYNTAX

           FINISH

   DESCRIPTION

           Any files which have not been closed are closed, and pending data
           is written from the buffers.  All devices are deassigned.

           Useful after aborting a program with two ^Cs to close  files that
           may be partially  written.  If this is  not done, the  next RESET
           operation will cause the file  to be closed in a manner that will
           save the previous version, if any.
