VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility







                            Introduction

The  Account  Supervisor on  a  Tymcom-X account  is  responsible for
establishing the "rules" for the use of Project-Codes (PJC's)  by his
users.  For this, Tymshare  provides a program called VALID  by which
he may declare to the system:
                Which users may use PJC's without restriction
                Which users' PJC's will be restricted
  and,          How the restricted users' PJCs will be verified

The VALID program is accessed by the system command ".R VALID".  Only
Account-Supervisors  or  Tymshare  personnel  may  run  this program.
VALID accepts as input some  option keywords from the terminal  and a
disk  file  containing  text describing  the  restrictions  which the
Account Supervisor would like to have enforced.

Before reading further,  please read the write-up  entitled "Tymcom-X
Project-Code Facility Users' Guide".





                Use of VALID; General Considerations

VALID processes  a descriptive text  file, encodes  the descriptions,
and  writes   the  encoded  descriptions   into  various   files  and
directories in  your account.  You  should keep a  copy of  this text
file  for  reference  in  the  event  that  you  need  to  know  what
restrictions are in effect.   VALID also produces an  optional output
listing file describing its  actions in response to  the commandments
in the input text file.  You will probably want to keep this listing,
also.

As described in the Users'  Guide, 3 classes of service  exist within
the  Project-Code Facility.   Class 0  users will  not be  subject to
restriction  and will  not be  of much  concern to  you or  the VALID
program.

A user is, by default, a Class 0 user until you declare otherwise via
the VALID program.
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


Class 1 users are required  by the system to satisfy a  program which
YOU have  written.  Your  program may  use any  criteria it  likes to
validate a  PJC, so long  as the character-restrictions  mentioned in
the guide are observed:  a  PJC is 12 ASCII characters  not beginning
with asterisk "*",  and not containing semicolon,  carriage-return or
linefeed.  In  addition, some other  restrictions on  character usage
are sensible:
1.  Do not try to put leading blanks in a PJC.
2.  Do not use TAB characters.
3.  Do not make heavy use of non-printing controls.
        (For your class 2 users:
        Avoid ^Q ^U ^A ^W ^D ESC (ALTMODE).  These mean
        something to the Editor with which you construct
        your text file, and you only make it confusing
        for all to put these into the text.)

The  program which  you  have written  will  need to  offer  the same
services  as are  offered  by the  Tymshare-written  program PROJECT,
described  in the  Guide.   It may  be  written in  FORTRAN.   In the
description  below, the  phrase  "(ASNAME)ASPROG" will  refer  to the
program you have written.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that this program reside in a directory  in your
account.  Probably in your directory is best.

Class  2 users  are required  by  the system  to supply  a  PJC which
matches one in a  list of PJC's you  give to VALID. Given  this list,
VALID  makes  a  hash  table file  called  "PROJ.COD"  in  the user's
directory. Each user can have  his own list, in his own  PROJ.COD, or
users may share  a PROJ.COD file.  The  PROJECT program will  look in
the appropriate PROJ.COD file  whenever the user asks to  change PJC.
The system will notice any modification which the user makes  on this
file, and refuse to validate PJC's from it thereafter.  You  are thus
assured that what  you put there will  not be changed  with impunity.
In the description below,  the phrase "(ASNAME)PROJ.COD" will  mean a
hash table which you explicitly name which resides in  your directory
[or some other directory in your account].





                   Syntax of Descriptive Text File

The descriptive file (the "source") consists of a sequence of entries
each of which describes the  status of a single user.   Entries begin
with a line that starts  with asterisk, "*" followed by  username and
other information.
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


You may construct  the source file in  the Tymshare Editor or  in the
editor called EDIT10, whichever is more comfortable for you.   In the
syntax of *USERNAME  lines below, spaces may  be replaced by  tabs or
multiple space characters.

The items inside  of curly braces,  {{'s and }}'s,  are alternatives.
You must select one of them.

The  items inside  of square  brackets, [['s  and ]]'s,  are options.
They can be totally omitted.

The words "PROGRAM",  "LIST" ,"FILE", "NOVERIFY" "BILLING:  USER" and
"BILLING:  PROJECT"  are   literal  keywords  recognized   by  VALID.
Everything on  a source  line following a  semicolon is  considered a
comment by VALID.

The general form of an entry is:
*USERNAME KEYWORD(S) (ASNAME)ASFILENAME [;COMMENT]


1. Form for class 1 user:

*USERNAME "PROGRAM" (ASNAME)ASPROG [;COMMENT]


So,  for example,  you  might write:  *JONES  PROGRAM (JOHNSON)ASPROG
;COMMENT if you  wished user JONES to  be forced to verify  thru your
program (JOHNSON)ASPROG, and have the system assume that  his billing
for  storage is  to be  by username.   [See below  for  discussion of
BILLING option].

2. Form for class 2 user:

*USERNAME "LIST" [;COMMENT]
First Project-Code
Second PJC
Third PJC
  etc.
  .
  .
(list ends at next *USERNAME line)

Another format for the class 2 user is:

*USERNAME "FILE" (ASNAME)FILE.EXT  [;COMMENT]

This is useful if  you want to have  many class 2 users  verify using
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


the same list of  PJC's.  You set it  up in one of  their directories
using  the "LIST"  form, then  name that  file in  subsequent entries
using the "FILE" form.  For example:
*JONES LIST  ;BARNES,ALBERT & JACOBS ALL USE THIS LIST
K-333
L-101                   ;THIS ONE NEW EFFECTIVE 17 JUNE 76
K-375
B-242
A-1001                  ;SPECIAL ACCOUNTING PROJECT
*BARNES FILE (JONES)PROJ.COD
*ALBERT FILE (JONES)PROJ.COD
*JACOBS FILE (JONES)PROJ.COD  ;JACOBS NEW AS OF 10 AUG 76

This example illustrates the use of comments to keep the  source file
informative.   Also  note that  the  PJC lines  may  contain comments
(everything  after  the semicolon)  but  that the  PJC  is everything
literally up to 12  characters unless a semicolon or  carriage return
is seen  sooner.  Therefore,  do not TAB  over from  the PJC  to your
comment or the TAB will be taken as part of the code.

It is likely that  you may want the  PROJ.COD file to reside  in your
own directory, but  you may not wish  to be subject to  it, yourself.
The next example illustrates how to set this up.  Assume that Account
Supervisor JOHNSON is to be a class 0 user.

3. Form for Class 0:

*USERNAME "NOVERIFY" [;COMMENT]
This is useful where you wish to remove somebody
from class 1 or 2 to class 0.  For example, take
Account Supervisor JOHNSON above:
*JOHNSON LIST ;THIS LIST IS FOR BARNES,JONES & ALBERT
K-333
L-101
K-375
B-242
A-2001
*BARNES FILE (JOHNSON)PROJ.COD
*JONES FILE (JOHNSON)PROJ.COD
*ALBERT FILE (JOHNSON)PROJ.COD
*JOHNSON NOVERIFY ;JOHNSON REVERTS TO CLASS 0 HERE

The NOVERIFY keyword is not  necessary when you are setting  up users
the very first  time who have  not been classified  for Project-Codes
before.  Remember that they are already Class 0 by default  until you
have put them in class 1 or 2.

                           BILLING Option

In cases where the extra  expense is justified, you may  want storage
charges in some user  directories to be broken down  by Project-Code.
The  VALID program  provides a  way for  you to  declare this  to the
system.  The default  setting is billing by  username, if you  omit a
declaration altogether.

The BILLING declaration has two forms:  "BILLING: USER" and "BILLING:
PROJECT".   This declaration  must proceed  the other  keywords which
determine the class.  Therefore,  the complete form for a  user entry
is:

*USERNAME {BILLING-DECLARATION} CLASS-KEYWORD FILENAME [;COMMENT]

The BILLING: USER form is recognized for completeness' sake by VALID,
but  is  in  a  sense  superfluous,  since  if  the  BILLING: PROJECT
declaration is  not seen,  BILLING: USER is  assumed.  Note  that you
cannot change the BILLING attribute  by itself and leave the  user in
his  present class,  etc.   Each time  VALID processes  an  entry, it
erases all  previous options that  may have been  in effect  for that
user  and establishes  the ones  which are  explicitly  or implicitly
declared in that entry.  Therefore your source file always accurately
represents the current restrictions in force.





         Operating VALID: Option Keywords to control a run.

As  mentioned in  the Introduction,  VALID accepts  some  keywords or
"switches" which  control its  execution.  To run  VALID and  set the
options, use the system command ".R VALID".  The program will respond
with "OPTIONS:".   Type any  of the  following keywords  separated by
spaces or commas:

LIST            To produce a listing
NOLIST          +To suppress listing
TEST            To make a dry run. More detail below
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


CONFIRM         To be asked to confirm all file over-writes
NOCONFIRM       +To have VALID go ahead & over-write old files
ABORT           To stop the run after the first error
PROCEED         +To keep going even if errors encountered.
INPUT=file      To name the source descriptive text file
                 and skip being prompted for it later.

If  you  simply  give  a carriage  return  to  OPTIONS:,  the default
settings will be: NOLIST  PROCEED NOCONFIRM.  In the list  above, the
"+" signs indicate which of a pair is the default.

LIST option:  VALID will write a listing of its actions on a  file of
extension ".LST" whose name is that of the source input file, in much
the same way as the FORTRAN compiler creates .REL and .LST files.  If
your input is from BLUB.IN, a listing will be written on BLUB.LST.

TEST  option:   VALID  creates  PROJ.COD  files  and  writes  in user
directories, we said in  the Introduction.  However, you can  use the
TEST switch to get a dry run which will uncover any  typographical or
other  errors  in  your  source file  without  writing  any  files or
directories.

CONFIRM option:   VALID may find  that PROJ.COD  files  already exist
for the users you name in  your source.  If you have set  the CONFIRM
switch, VALID will pause with the message "USERNAME  OLD FILE?".  You
may give "Y" or "N". If  "N" is given, the old PROJ.COD file  will be
left untouched.

ABORT option: VALID will issue error messages for a number of reasons
as it processes the source.   If you have set ABORT, VALID  will quit
at the end of processing  for the current user.  This is  valuable if
you are  making a real  run and  want to stop  before doing  too much
damage.  See below for a discussion of error messages and what  to do
about them.

INPUT=file option:  This is a quick way to answer the  question which
VALID asks next after the OPTIONS question:

TEXT FILE INPUT:  This is a request for the name of  your descriptive
text file.  will be accepted.





                             SAMPLE RUN
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


Let  us  suppose  Account Supervisor  JOHNSON  has  created  the file
VALID.INP with the following specifications for his users:


*BARNES LIST
T-102 4Q76
T-177 3Q75
T-99
GENERAL
CLIENT X
CLIENT Y
CUSTOMER Z
B. F. SKINNER ASSOCIATES
*CARTER FILE (BARNES)PROJ.COD
*JONES FILE (BARNES)PROJ.COD
*WOLF BILLING:PROJECT LIST
R&D
PRODUCTION
*TROTTER PROGRAM (JOHNSON)CODES ;FORTRAN PROG BY L. SMITH
*SMITH (JOHNSON)CODES
*WILLIAMS NOVERIFY 
*TAYLOR PROGRAM (JOHNSON)CODES

First of all  we may note that  JOHNSON  has not included  himself in
this specification file.  He does  not have to if he wants  to remain
in whatever class he is in.

We may also note that in specifying the program  (JOHNSON)CODES, that
it is not necessary to give the extension.

JOHNSON  submits  this source  file  to VALID  for  a dry  run  and a
listing:
.R VALID
OPTIONS: TEST,LIST,CONFIRM
TEXT INPUT FILE: VALID.INP
and receives some error messages:
BAD PROJECT CODE B. F. SKINNE   USER BARNES   ERROR!
LINE 16  SPECIFICATION ??   USER SMITH    ERROR!
COULDN'T SET SPECIFICATIONS FOR USER  TAYLOR   ERROR!
E.O.F.
ERROR(S): 3
E.O.J.

Now he types his listing file
.TYPE VALID.LST

BAD PROJECT CODE B. F. SKINNE   USER BARNES ERROR!
-----BARNES USES (BARNES)PROJ.COD STORAGE BILLED BY USERNAME
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


-----CARTER USES (BARNES)PROJ.COD STORAGE BILLED BY USERNAME
-----JONES USES (BARNES)PROJ.COD STORAGE BILLED BY USERNAME
-----WOLF USES (WOLF)PROJ.COD STORAGE BILLED BY PROJ CODE
-----TROTTER USES (JOHNSON)CODES.SAV STORAGE BILLED BY USERNAME
LINE 16  SPECIFICATION ??  USER SMITH   ERROR!
-----WILLIAMS USES (.NONE.) STORAGE BILLED BY USERNAME
COULDN'T SET CLASSIFICATION FOR USER TAYLOR   ERROR!

Note  that the  message "----WILLIAMS  USES (.NONE.)  ...."  does not
indicate anything  wrong.  This  will appear for  all users  put into
class 0 by NOVERIFY.





                      Error Messages from VALID

Many  messages from  VALID  indicate simple  typographical  or syntax
errors which will be obvious  from perusing the source file.   In the
above example, we have 2 trivial errors and one more substantial one.
BAD PROJECT CODE xxxx messages  result from PJC's that are  too long.
The truncated PJC was put in the PROJ.COD file. LINE nn SPECIFICATION
?? messages result from VALID not finding one of its keywords BILLING
PROGRAM  FILE  LIST NOVERIFY  after  the username.   In  the example,
PROGRAM was accidentally not typed.

"LINE nn USERNAME ??"  message:  VALID cannot recognize  the username
following the "*".  It must be 12 characters or less.

"SYNTAX  ERROR   USER  username"  messages  are  a  general catch-all
message from  not adhering  to the  syntax described  above.  Typical
reasons:   left out  a keyword  or part  of (ASNAME)ASPROG  or didn't
start comment with semicolon.

"SYNTAX   ORDER  ERROR,   USER  xxx"   comes  from   putting  BILLING
declarations after  the FILE/LIST/PROGRAM  ASPROG keywords.   It must
precede them.

"CAN'T FIND xxxx.xxx, BETTER FIX  THIS" happens when you name  a FILE
or PROGRAM which  doesn't yet exist.   VALID can proceed,  but things
will not work properly when it comes time to use the facility  if you
do not first create the program/file, then re-run VALID.

"GIVING  WRITE-PROJECT LICENSE  TO filename"  is an  advisory message
that does not indicate  anything wrong.  This license is  required by
your validation program and any PROJ.COD files but cannot be  used by
anyone to destroy files or information.
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


"COULDN'T SET CLASSIFICATION FOR USER name" messages result  if VALID
is unable to access  the directory of the  user.  If you name  a user
outside your account, you will get this message.

"NO DIRECTORY, USER  CANNOT BE SET UP  YET. USER name"  messages mean
that the named user does not yet exist to the system.  If he has been
validated on the system  by your Tymshare representative but  has not
yet logged in,  this message may appear.   The solution:  GFD  to his
directory,  then GFD  back.   This will  create the  directory  if it
doesn't already exist.

"UFD INTERLOCK  BUSY FOR  name" messages  can happen  if one  of your
users gets hung up trying to  log in. It should be a rare  message if
you ever get  it at all. Bring  it to your  Tymshare representative's
attention.

"BAD  PROJECT  CODE  xxxxx"  means that  the  code  was  too  long or
contained an illegal character.

"LIST 'WAY TOO BIG, USER xxx" messages will be rare.  The system will
presently handle lists  of over 600 Project  Codes.  If you  get this
message, probably your source file became garbaged.  If  it persists,
please consult your Tymshare representative.

"EMPTY CODE LIST, SERIOUS TROUBLE FOR USER name" means  exactly that:
You have said "*USERNAME LIST" and followed it immediately by another
"*USERNAME" line.  This guy will not be able to get onto the system.

"CORE UUO FAIL SET.HT" is a message that indicates a  system problem.
Please bring your output to the attention of Tymshare.

"BHASH PAST JOBREL", "GRABBING  PG FOR STRING", "STRING ATE  UP WHOLE
BUFFER!","PRIME  0  IN  HT",  "2NDARY  PROBE  OUT  OF  RANGE", "TABLE
OVERFLOW!", "FILE WRITE FAILED", "**SYSTEM CALL WPJ RENAME FAILED**",
"XMISSION ERRORS", and "CAN'T  INIT DUMP CHANNEL" messages  are other
system problem messages to bring to Tymshare's attention.





            Writing, Loading & Debugging "(ASNAME)ASPROG"

As we  said, your PJC-verifier  for class 1  users may be  written in
FORTRAN.  There are some subtleties however which require  linkage to
Assembly-Language  routines and  the assistance  of a  Tymshare field
analyst.  Please  contact your Tymshare  representative, who  can put
VALID: Tymcom-X Account-Supervisor Project-Code Facility


you  in  contact  with  the  proper  analyst  and  provide  you  with
information on  the available Assembly-Language  routines for  you to
use.

Remember that whatever program you write will become very privileged,
having  the  authority  to  keep  users  from  entering  the  system.
Therefore it  must be thoroughly  checked-out before being  placed in
service.  Again, this debugging and checkout phase will require a bit
of assistance from the Tymshare analyst.

Documentation  available  from  Tymshare  describes   the  subtleties
mentioned  above, and  outlines the  restrictions which  your am
must observe and actions it must take.
