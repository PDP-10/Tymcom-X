Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

ONCE DIALOG:
    ONCE> HELP

    TYPE     Report information about the system.
             TYPE CORE   - the default minimum core available to users.
             TYPE SYSTEM - reports the system number.

    CHANGE   Change information about the system.
             CHANGE CORE   - changes the default minimum user core.
             CHANGE SYSTEM - changes the system number.

    FULL     Bring up the system with a FULL DSKCLN.  If there is any
             question about the integrity of the file system, then this
             command should be used in place of GO.  Unless authorized,
             DO NOT enter the FILES dialogue to set the DSKCLN type.

    GO       Bring up the system with the default settings and start
             the auto-restart process.

    FILES    Enter the FILES dialogue.  This is the subsystem of ONCE
             which is normally used ONLY for restructuring or repairing
             the disk file system.  The commands in this subsystem could
             damage the file system if they are used incorrectly.  If you
             are NOT sure of what you are doing, DO NOT enter this section.

    READONLY Bring up the system SHUT for emergency examination.
             Writing on the disk is prevented until DSKCLN has been run.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    CONSOLE  Allow the system to be brought up on the CONSOLE terminal ONLY.
             The system MUST be reloaded before it can be brought up on the
             network.  This command should be followed by a command to bring
             up the system (one of: GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY).

    NETWORK  Allow the system to be brought up on the NETWORK (default).
             This allows normal access to the system and overrides any
             previous CONSOLE or NETWORK commands.  This command should be
             followed by a command to bring up the system. (see CONSOLE.)

    DDT      Enter executive DDT.  To be used ONLY by software wizards
             for emergency patching and examination of the monitor.
             UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU NORMALLY USE THIS COMMAND!

    MANUAL   Bring up the system in the SHUT state for DEBUGGING ONLY!
             The auto-restart process is not performed.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    BOOTS    Crash the system with "BOOTS LOADED" immediately.

For KS-10 only:
    KMC      Bring the system up loading the KMC-11 but without the
             rest of the automatic restart procedure.  This must NEVER
             be used for a restart after a system CRASH.  ONLY to be
             used when the system has been taken down gracefully and
             DSKCLN has already been run.
